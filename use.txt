Joe, runt as he was, had two sources of pride — the 
aristocratic lineage of his "owners," for he had 
belonged to the Heywards, and the achievement, on his 
own behalf, of the paternity of twins. Poor, patient 
Philippa, being only the mother, and a person of no 
family to speak of, having been the slave of a Charles- 
ton baker — whose fortunes rose during the war, though 
his Confederate yeast didn't — Philippa, of the bour- 
geoisie, was not taken into account. "Dem two twin 
duh my'own," and "Me nyuse to blonx to Mass Clinch,' 
were the Andante and Allegro of Joe's prideful song. 
When some lusty young wench, during the customary 
"chaffing" of the plantation dinner hour, would ridi- 
cule his small size, Joe would swell with impor- 
tance, grin like a 'possum, and overwhelm her with the 
retort: "Little axe cut down big tree! You see dem two 
twin, entyi Dem duh my'own.'''' But the "two twins," 
poor little dusky wights, were in evidence in the 
neighborhood and could be estimated :it their true 
value and Joe's paternal prowess appraised accord- 
ingly, but "Mass Clinch" lived away off "een Walter- 
burruh" and, later, as governor, in Columbia, and his 
name, mouthed unctuously by his former slave, carried 
with it a weird, mystical importance, a portentous 
something that held his auditors with staring eyes 
and dropping jaws till Joe reached his climax, when 
the tension relaxed and they returned to earth. 

Once started, Joe's imagination fed upon his words 
as a dog upon his own fleas. One day when Philippa 
reprobated his want of industry, Joe, other negroes 
being present, began to brag: "Wunnuh haffuh wu'k 
'cause wunnuh blan blonx to po' buckruh. Yo' niaus- 
suh \se7f haffuh wu'k ! Enty I shum een town one time

"Enty yo' maussuh wu'k, Joe?" 

"Who? My Maussuh? Mass Clinch? 'Ooman, you

"Seb'n tfous n' acre 1 P

" 'No, suh, dat de haa'bis' flow.' " 

" 'De debble'!" 'e say. " "E mus' be mos' time fuh

" 'Yaas, suh. We gwine hab some fuh dinnuh'." 


" 'Wuh else you got fuh eat?' ' Maussuh quizzit'um. 

" 'We got one cootuh soup mek out'uh tarrypin' wuh

"'You hab enny mint?'" 

" 'Yaas, suh, we hab 'nuf ." 

" 'Berry well, mek we a few julip'," 'e say. " 'You

" 'No, I t'engk you',"' 'e say. " 'Leh de ribbuh tek

"Wen 'e gitt'ru 'e bittle, 'e hab 'e fo" hawss* hitch up,

my maussuh !" 

By the time Joe concluded his story the noon hour 
was over, and the awed negroes rose silently to resume 
their work. One old mauma, turning to Joe as she 
knocked the ashes out of her clay pipe and carefully 
stuck it in the knotty wool behind her ear, said, "Joe, 
dat duh Gawd you binnuh talk 'bout, enty?" 

"No, enty I tell wunnuh duh Mass Clinch Heywu'd! 
Him duh my maussuh, me duh him nigguh. Me ain' 
ha Huh wu'k, him ain' haffuh wu'k. Wen wunnuh look 
'puntop'uh she, wunnuh look 'puntop'uh me. Me en' 
him alltwo stan' same fashi'n." 

k 'I t'aw't," said the old woman, scornfully, "I t'aw't 
V nius" be de blessed Gawd you bin gib shishuh high 
praise, but I always yeddy suh Him duh de ainjul' 
maussuh, en' I yeddy suh de ainjul' w'ite en' shiny 
lukkuh taar een de sky, but you, nigguh ! YOU black ez uh buzsut.'"  

How beneficent must have been the institution of 
slavery under kindly masters which could cause Joe 
Fields, black, yellow-eyed, knock-kneed, slew-footed, 
longtime husband of Philippa, sometime father of 
twins, to boast, 53 years after the war, of the prowess 
and attainments of his former master, Duncan Clinch 
Heyward, sometime governor of South Carolina, now 
collector of internal revenue and sitting at the receipt 
of customs in the tall Palmetto building at Columbia, 
with dominion over war tax, surtax and every other 
impost internally levied by a benevolent government 
upon its loyal people. Although, perhaps, an infant in 
arms when Joe first looked freedom in the face, this 
"master" was exalted in, the mind of his former slave 
to almost Godlike proportions. "Joe' maussuh duh 
him Jedus," conservatively remarked Philippa. 

The negroes about Pon Pon had been considerably 
exercised over the lengthening of the daylight hours 
by pushing forward the hands of the clock. Always 
suspicious of a Caucasian in the woodpile, it was gen- 
erally regarded as a device for increasing the hours of 
negro labor. At a recent gathering of the idle black 
at Adams Run station, the opinion was expressed that 
the President, although a "Dimmycrack," must be "a 
smaa't man" to have lengthened the days on the dar- 
keys and taken over the railroads. 

New York, in the minds of the coast negroes, is the 
ultima Thole — at once the farthest North, and the 
very core and center of Yankeedoni, where, in awful 
majesty, the President of the United States is supposed to sit like Zeus upon Mt. Olympus, or "my 
maussuh" in Columbia. 

"Yaas, man," said Joe, "de Prezzydent smaa't man, 
fuh true, but 'e vent smaa't lukkuh maussuh, 'cause my 
maussuh hatf'uh gone New Yawk fuh tell de Prezzydent wiih fuh do. Same lukkuh maussuh tell Mistuh

Under whatever star Philippa had been born, she 
had known only ill luck since her acquisition of a hus- 
band in Joe Fields, the slew-footed former slave of 
former Governor Heyward. Joe's pride in his for- 
mer master was too great to permit him to walk, and 
the mortgaged horse or mule which he usually owned 
seldom lived very long on the light rations and scant 
attention it received. Its demise would soon be fol- 
lowed by another animal purchase, another mortgage, 
and another death. Joe occasionally worked when it 
suited him, but Philippa toiled unceasingly, and, 
although she seldom lived at home, she was very proud 
of the little establishment which her labor maintained. 
Always distrustful of Joe, she yet gave him the cus- 
tody of, and dominion over, the few material things 
she possessed, representing in her character the con- 
tradictions not infrequently met with among those of 
her sex in higher circles. 

Once upon a time, Philippa aspired to animal hus- 
bandry. Tired of buying bacon for Joe at the Cross 
Roads store, she applied the savings of several months 
of hard labor to the purchase of a young sow, and, per- 
haps in compliment to Joe, she bought a Berkshire, 
the blackest pig she could find. During the months 
of anticipation, while she worked for the money with 
which to make the purchase, her mind was full of the 
little black pigs that some time would be running 
about her yard around the cabin in the woodland, fur- 
nishing meat in prospect, and immediate companion- 
ship for Joe and their taciturn black daughter, Chris- 
topher Columbus, who kept the home fires burning 
with whatever lightwood knots she could pick up in 
the pineland, while the wife and mother worked for 
"de buckruh" several miles away. 

"Joe en' Cuhlumbus sho' gwine hab uh good cum- 
p'ny w'en uh buy da' hog en' sen' um home," she 
thought. "Ef uh kin raise ten pig' dis'yeah, maybe 
nex' yeah uh kin raise two-t'ree hund'ud, en' dem kin 
git 'nuf fuh eat een de swamp en' de pinelan' bidout 
buy "urn no bittle." 

So her fancy pictured her humble premises teeming 
with little pigs, first squirming in their beds among 
the straw, then grunting and running about the place, 
while Joe and Columbus, squatting on the door step 
of the cabin, communed with them in spirit and 
watched them grow. Later, the husky shoats would 
forage the pinelands and swamps for mast and acorns, 
and root about in the muddy branches for slugs and 
crayfish, then, grown to fat porkers, they would be 
slaughtered, salted and smoked, and hams, shoulders, 
and flitches would hang in festoons from the cabin 
rafters. So they successively passed through the seven 
ages of swine. At last the sow that was to transmute 
Philippa's dreams into realities was bought and paid 
for, and a message dispatched to Joe to come and take 
her home. In due time he arrived with ox and cart and, 
admonished by Philippa to meet the responsibility 
placed upon him, he drove away, the guardian of her 
hopes. 

But Joe was not a forward-looking man. His eyes, 
lacking speculation, were filled with the insistent mate- 
rialism of the moment. A present pig was worth a 
hundred in prospect. His eyeballs popped and his lips 
leaked as he viewed Opportunity that grunted so tan- 
talizingly at his door, and the gnawing of "Guamba" 
(the meat hunger of the savage African tribes) played 
Lady Macbeth to his halting thoughts of murder and 
turned them into resolution. 

'"Yaas, ma'am, uh glad fuh git uh chance fuh wu'k

Though the abandoned Joe made bones of Philippa's

"Joe, you sho' iz fat."

Several years ago there lived on the "Lewisburg" 
rice plantation of former Governor Duncan Clinch 
Heyward, one Monday White, a yellow negro and a 
persistent and imaginative practical joker. The little 
"Devil's Fiddles'' which boys construct of empty tin 
cans and rosined string emit unchristian squeaks and 
groans when played upon with smooth hardwood 
sticks, and Monday believed that a similar device on a 
larger scale could be so manipulated as to frighten into 
hysterics half the negro population along Combahee 
Eiver. Begging from the store a large empty powder 
keg, he surreptitiously rigged it up with stout twine 
which, well rubbed with rosin and scraped with a dry 
hickory stick for a bow, produced a hoarse and horri- 
ble sound which might have passed among the un- 
initiated for the roar of a lion — or for anything else. 

Monday knew that the superstitious negroes feared 
most the unknown. The negro who would have taken 
a chance with alligator or bull, or the even more dan- 
gerous hind legs of a mule, could be scared stiff by a 
weird, unfamiliar sound in the woods at night. So 
Monday decided that the ear- jarring sound emitted by 
his double-bass "'Devil's Fiddle" should do service for 
the roar of a lion, as these creatures were unknown on 
Combahee, and the few negroes who had once seen lions 
when the circus visited Walterboro, brought back mar- 
velous tales of their ferocity and their terrible voices. 

Monday baited his victims skilfully. One Saturday 
night when the store was crowded with trading 
negroes, he led the conversation lionwards. He needed 
tales of terror, and the two or three negroes who had 
once seen lions were willing to oblige. One of them 
had even seen them fed. "Wen uh bin Walterburruh, 
nh look 'puntop one dem annimel f uh call lion, en' uh 
shum w'en dem duh gem 'e bittle fuh eat." 

"Nigguh g'em 'e bittle? 

"No man, buckiuih feed'um. Nigguh ent fuh feed'um. 
Da' t'ing dainjus tummuch ! Nigguh duh him bittle. 
Lion en' nigguh alltwo come f'uni Atf'iky, en' w'en dem 
Ait'ikin king en' t'ing hab lion een dem cage, 'e gem uh

en' w'en da' t'ing look 'puntop de meat, 'e tail t'rash'

yez en' run out de tent, en' gone !" 

"Tengk Gawd dem annimel nebbuh come 'puntop 
Cumbee!" a woman fervently exclaimed. 

"Yaas, tittie," said another, "ef da' t'ing ebbuh come 
yuh, me fuh run Sabannuh. Uh nebbuh stop run 'tell 
uh done pass de Yamassee!" 

Others joined in the trembling chorus and Monday, 
when they had become sufficiently worked up, shrewdly 
spilled the first spoonful of powder leading to his mine. 
"Oonuh nigguh, one buckruh binnuh talk 'puntop de 
llatfawm to W'ite Hall deepo dis mawnin', en' uh 
yeddy'um tell dem torruh buckruh suh one sukkus hab 


uh acksident to Orangebu'g, en' one lion git out 'e

fuh ketch'um but dem 'f'aid fuh gone een de swain p. 
en' dem sen' dem dog attuhr'um, en' de lion kill t'irteen 
beagle one time!" 

"Oh Jedus!" cried an excited woman, "Uh berry 
'f'aid da' t'ing gwine come Cumbee! Hummuch mile 
Orangebu'g stan' f'um yuh?" 

"Uh dunno hummuch mile," Monday replied, "but 
uh know lion kin mek'um 'tween middlenight en' day- 
clean, en' ef uh ebbuh yeddy 'e woice roll een dish'yuh 
swamp, meself gwine git een me trus'me'gawd coonoo 
en' uh fuh gone down Cumbee ribbuh, en' uh nebbuh 
stop paddle 'tell uh git Beefu't !" 

A week passed. Like the waves from a stone thrown 
into still waters, the lion stories spread among the out- 
lying plantations in all directions. Saturday night 
found Monday early at the store. Another convenient 
buckra at White Hall station had told that morning of 
the lion's escape from the Edisto and his crossing over 
the intervening pinelands into the Salkehatchie 
Swamp and, as most people know, the Salkehatchie 
River, below the line of the Charleston and Savannah 
railway, becomes the Combahee. The lion was loose, 
therefore, in their own proper swamp, and might even 
now be riding a floating log down the current of their 
beloved river ! 

Monday stealthily slipped out. An hour later, when 
the negroes in and about the store had worked them- 
selves up to a delectable pitch of excitement, an 
unearthly groaning roar came from the woods nearby. 
The night was hot, but the negroes almost froze with 
fear, and the clerk, in whom Monday had confided, 
raised no objection when the negroes within the store 
called in their companions from the outside and asked 
permission to bar the door. 

"Oonuh yeddy'um, enty ! Wuh uh tell you 'bout da' 
t'ing' woice?" said the negro who had seen lions in 
Walterboro. 

Monday's "Devil's Fiddle" groaned again, and as its 
dying notes trembled on the summer night, a rush was 
made to close and bolt the windows. The kerosene 
lamps smoked and flared in the fetid air. The men 
listened and shuddered as the recurrent roars, now 
muffled, reached their expectant ears. The women 
wailed. "O Gawd ! uh lef me t'ree chillun shet up een 
me house," cried one. "Uh 'spec' da' t'ing done 
nyam'um all by dis time!" 

"Shet yo' mout', 'ooman," said a masculine comforter. 
"Hukkuh him kin eat en' holluh alltwo one time ? Yo' 
chillun ent fuh eat." 

"Me lef my juntlemun een de house," said another 
woman, with resignation, "Uh 'spec' him done eat." 

"Wuh you duh bodduh 'bout loss uh man?" said the 
mother. "Man easy fuh git tummuch. Me vent duh bod- 
duh 'bout man. Uh kin git anodduh juntlemun ef da' 
t'ing nyam my 'own, but weh uh fuh git mo' chillun?" 

"Go'way, gal, ef you kin fuh git anodduh juntlemun, 
same fashi'n Gawd help you fuh git anodduh chillun." 

After a while the roaring ceased and the clerk, being 
perilously near suffocation, calmed the fears of the 
negroes and opened the windows. The trembling 
darkeys cocked their ears and listened apprehensively, 
but the shrilling of the Cicada among the pines and the 
bellowing of the bullfrogs in the distant canals were 
the only sounds that broke the silence of the night so 
recently full of terrors. After awhile the door also 
was unbarred and opened, and a bold man borrowed an 
axe from the storekeeper and adventured far enough 
to cut some slabs of lightwood from a familiar stump. 
The hero added to his popularity by splitting these up 
and distributing them among the members of the 
gentler sex, whose escorts lighted torches and convoyed 
them in a body back to the quarters, where the children 
and husbands whom they left at home were found 
intact. 

At church on Sunday, the Lewisburg negroes spread 
among their brethren from the other plantations the 
news of the coming of the lion, and the "locus pastuh" 
fervently touched upon the king of beasts. "Puhtec' 
we, Maussuh Jedus, f'um da' t'ing oonuh call lion. 
Lead'um, Lawd, to weh de buckruh' cow en' t'ing' duh 
bite grass so him kin full 'e belly bedout haffuh nyam 
nigguh, en' ef 'e yiz haffuh tek nigguh fuh 'e bittle. do, 
Lawd, mek'um fuh tek dem sinful nigguh wuh ent wut, 
en' lef de Lawd' renointed. Mek'um fuh do wid de 
good sistuh en' bredduh 'puntop dis plantesshun same 
lukkuh oonuh mek'um fuh do long Dannil — " "Yaas, 
Lawd," shouted Monday, the hypocrite, "ef 'e yiz fuh 
eat nigguh, mek'um fuh eat dem nigguh 'puntop'uh 
Bonny Hall 'cross de ribbuh, en' tek 'e woice out'uh we 
pinelan'." "Yaas, Lawd!" "Please suh fuh do'um, 
Lawd !" shouted the fervent brethren and sisters. And 
stealthily, about two hours after dark that night, while 
the emotional negroes were alternately laughing, shout- 
ing and praying, Monday put his Devil's Fiddle into 
a sack, slipped into his canoe, and, crossing to the 
opposite shore of the river, roared frightfully along 
the Bonny Hall water line, terrifying the negroes on 
that plantation and filling the Lewisburg darkeys with 
thankfulness that their prayers had been answered. 

Another week passed. Monday, playing with them 
as a cat plays with a mouse, kept quiet, until by Satur- 
day night, no news having come of any damage at 
Bonny Hall, the Lewisburg negroes hoped that the lion 
had been captured by "de sukkus buckruh," or had left 
the neighborhood, and soon after nightfall, half the 
plantation gathered at the store. 

About nine o'clock, when the store was jammed with 
briskly trading negroes, from afar in the woods came 
the ominous roar of the hand-made lion. It was dis- 
tant, and the negroes, while badly frightened, stood 
their ground to await developments, but a few minutes 
later the awful sound came again from a nearer point, 
and by the time the roaring had come within a 
quarter of a mile of the place, the negroes were 
panic-stricken, and most of them hurried from the 
store and ran to the quarters, where they bolted them- 
selves in, to pass a night in fear and trembling, for at 
intervals until past midnight, their ears carried terror 
to their souls. On Sunday, Monday, wearing the sanc- 
timonious expression of a cat that has just swallowed 
the canary, moved among them, listening with sympa- 
thetic ears to the tales of perilous adventures that some 
of them had experienced. "Bredduh W'ite," said a 
church sister, "lemme tell you. Las' night uh gone to 
Sistuh Bulow' house attuh daa'k. Uh did'n' bin to de

dreadful experience told by one negro, being over- 
matched by the next, who, if one gave ''free rein" to her 
imagination, would be sure to strip the bridle off her's 
and throw it away. "Meself shum," related a 20th Cen- 
tury Munchausen in petticoats. "Uh bin down de road

Monday inclined his ear and listened to the negroes, 
but he showed them no mercy, and before the end of 
the third week his lion became so bold that a roar came 
even in broad daylight from among the reeds along the 
river bank, frightening the laborers out of the fields 
and even prompting a neighboring planter to order his 
foreman to lock up the mules for safety when he saw 
the hands flying in terror from the ricefields! At last, 
to avoid industrial paralysis, the owner of the planta- 
tion, discovering Monday's plot, suppressed the powder 
keg lion. And the master saved his people, the Hal- 
cyon nested again on the waves of the Combahee, 
bringing peaceful days and peaceful ways to the 
Lewisburg plantation, with nothing more exciting 
than the quest of u da' skollup' petticoat," but — "that's 
another story." 

The lion of Lewisburg was dead. By order of former 
Governor Duncan Clinch Heyward, the Devil's Fiddle 
with which Monday White, yellow-skinned plantation 
practical joker, had terrorized the negroes of the neigh- 
borhood for three weeks, had been hidden away, and 
the groaning roar of the powder keg lion was no longer 
heard in the land. Monday, the clerk at the store and 
the master of the plantation, guarded the secret care- 
fully and the negroes, who no longer heard the ter- 
rible voice echoing through the woods at night, or 
along the reeds by the river, believed that the lion, 
exorcised by the spirit of prayer, had departed from 
among them and gone to some less regenerate com- 
munity. Those who had told marvelous tales of the 
fierce creature whose flaming eyes had burned into 
their souls, whose bloody jaws had frozen them with 
fright, told and retold with elaboration and close atten- 
tion to detail, — and finally themselves believed, the first 
told stories of their encounters with the monster. Some 
of those who had had no personal experience with the 
lion of Lewisburg believed only part of the oft told 
tales. Others were frankly skeptical, for, while prac- 
tically all of them believed in the lion, few were willing 
to yield to the storytellers the prestige of having come 
unscathed through such perilous adventures. These 
stories are alwavs liberallv discounted among the 
negroes, however. At a "baptizing"' on the Combahee, 
the big black pastor had doused in the canal one after 
another of the "seeking" sisters. They emerged from 
the turbid waters gurgling and choking, but all were 
too full of water, or the spirit, for utterance. At last 
one lusty wench with better breath control than the 
others came up smiling, and with wind enough for 
speech. "Oh Jedus!" she yelled, determined to create 
a sensation, "uh see Gawd onduhneet' de water! Uh 
fin' me Gawd. '# look 'puntop me!" 

"You lie!" said the envious sister who had just pre- 
ceded her, " His cootuh! Enty I shum?" 

Gradually the negroes recovered their confidence, 
and resumed their nocturnal rambles, visiting from one 
plantation to another, but they usually went in small 
companies and seldom adventured alone, save when 
some bibulous man, glimpsing the "skollup' petticoat" 
of the peripatetic bootlegger from White Hall as she 
swished her starched symbol through the Lewisburg 
quarters on Saturday nights, followed with parched 
tongue and arid throat to some convenient spot where 
coin could be exchanged for contraband. 

In some way it was generally understood that, sup- 
plementing the plantation prayers, "Mass Clinch," 
through personal magnetism or the exercise of some 
former-gubernatorial authority, had had a great deal 
to do with speeding the going leonine guest. This 
rumor traveled by grapevine thirty-odd miles from 
Combahee to Adams Run, the abiding place of Joe 
Fields, the former governor's former slave, whose con- 
fidence in "Maussuh's" powers of accomplishment, 
equalled the Mohammedan belief in the esteemed 
Prophet's ability to stock the Hereafter with Houris. 
It was true that "Maussuh" had commanded the roar- 
ing to cease — and it did, but Joe's imagination insisted 
upon supplying all the "corroborative detail." 

Joe foregathered with some of his friends at the rail- 
way station, for things were not going pleasantly at 
home. His wife Philippa was one of those hard-work- 
ing, aggravating creatures who, by her very industry 
and se'f -abnegation, forced upon the lordly loafer by 
whom she was husbanded a sense of his own inferior- 
ity. Philippa worked out among the white people, 
cooking and washing and scrubbing, while Joe rode 
about on a mortgaged horse or ox and boasted as a Sir 
Oracle at the Cross Roads or the station. Philippa 
was always willing to feed Joe, but she was none the 
less ready to season his food with the sauce of her 
tongue, and whenever she came home, her sense of duty 
urged her to remind Joe of his shortcomings. Once a 
fighter, hard work and scanty food had worn her body 
and somewhat broken her spirit, and she no longer 
thrashed her grown daughter Christopher Columbus 
as she once did, "jes' 'cause 'e look lukkuh 'e pa," but 
Joe, having to take the sauce with the meat, seldom 
wasted time in replying that he could utilize in eating, 
and thus the more speedily put himself out of earshot. 
Once away among his cronies, however, he expressed 
himself boldly and truculently. u Da' 'ooman keep on 
fuh onrabble 'e mout' 'tell uh w'ary fuh yeddy'um. 
'E stan' sukkuh briah patch w'en blackberry ripe. 'E

Old Friday Giles was the English purist of Penny 
Creek. A former "¦driver" and slave of Mr. Edward 
Barnwell, his manners were pompous, though ingratiat- 
ing. Plis speech was unusually good save for his ludic- 
rous use of "she" and "her" for all things singular, 
animate or inanimate. 

For many years "Old Barney," an Ayrshire bull 
acquired from the Barnwell family, was the terror of 
all the negroes roundabout. True to his Scottish 
breeding. Barney was both stubborn and acquisitive 
and lived up to 

"The good old rule * * * the simple plan 
That they should take who have the power 
And they should keep who can." 

Barney had the power. Therefore he took. He loved 
green pea vines as the Scot loves his haggis, and when- 
ever he fancied them he had but to lean against the 
miserable fences enclosing the negroes' patches, walk 
through, and help himself. The negroes would shoot 
him up with firearms and ammunition of all sorts and 
his hide was constantly full of lead of every size from 
mustard seed to swan shot, but fear kept the marksmen 
from getting near enough to hurt him seriously, so 
Barney philosophically took the lead without, and the 
peavines within, and after eating his fill would lie 
down in the field and chew his cud complacently, walk- 
ing out later through the owner's front yard, pausing 
to paw the dirt contemptuously and pull a few mouth- 
fuls from the Seewee bean vines that climbed about 
the garden palings. 

One day Friday's field was invaded, and, hat in 
hand, he came to the doorstep to complain. "Missis," 
he said, "dat bull Baa'ney, she is ridickilus ! Missis, I 
mek my fench ten rail high. I stake her and I rider 
her, but ole Baa'ney she put her breas' agains' my 
fench, she lean on her, she break her down. She enter 
my fiel', she eat my peas. I shoot her, but she is indif- 
ferent to my shot. When she conclude eatin' my peas, 
she lie down, and, Missis, she was so full that she could 
not rise! 1 ' But Fridav was a gentlemanlv old darkey 
and treated his sturdy, quick-talking wife, Minda, with 
great gallantry, practical gallantry, too, as she bore 
him (and raised) 17 sons and daughters, thereby earn- 
ing the well-done of her kindly though thrifty old 
master. "Maussuh lub me 'cause uh hab chillun so fas'," 
she boasted. "I fetch'um uh fine nigguh eb'rv year 
Gawd sen'!" — meaning that the old gentleman had a 
pre-Rooseveltian objection to race suicide on the plan- 
tation. 

Although old Bo'sun Smashum, the herdsman, who 
had raised Barney from a calf, would twist his tail in 
the barnyard and chevy him about with impunity, the 
bull was truculent toward outsiders and on more than 
one occasion disputed the highway with planters of the 
neighborhood, who were forced to turn back and drive 
a mile or so out of the way in the interest of safety; 
while negroes riding or driving oxen, on sighting Bar- 
ney in the road half a mile away, would take to the 
woods or the fields and make a wide and respectful 
detour. The danger would be enhanced should the ani- 
mal between the shafts of the primitive cart be one 
of the "bull yelliivs" so much affected by the freedmen 
for combination purposes. The silly song, "Everybody 
works but father," had not then been evolved from the 
near-brain of the writer of music hall lyrics, and the 
labors of a beast of burden were held not incompatible 
with the paternity of a bovine family. So these little 
creatures multiplied and continued to lead their double 
lives. Barney held in utter contempt even the authen- 
ticated bulls of the community, but he so terrorized 
the little harnessed scrubs that their owners could 
hardly avert a stampede when the great bull bellowed 
in the vicinity. 

One hot Sunday afternoon three or four hundred 
negroes were holding services at the old log church 
near the Parker's Ferry cross-roads. Too numerous 
for the building, they were using outdoor bush shelters 
covered with green boughs and with hewn saplings for 
seats. At the tail of a "distracted meetin' " that had 
been running for several days, while grass grew in 
their crops, they were in a state of exaltation, and the 
high, sweet voices of the women blended in harmony 
with the deep, rich basses of the men in the perfect 
rhythm characteristic of African music. Old time 
hymns and "sperrituals" alternated. At first, only two 
or three voices followed the leader, then one by one 
the singers joined in major and minor keys, until at 
the last the entire congregation swelled the diapason 
that floated away on the summer wind. The little oxen 
and bulls, whose harness permitted the indulgence, lay 
down at their hitching posts, the less fortunate stood 
between the shafts and chewed their cuds, drowsing 
with half-closed eyes in the soft, warm air of the pine- 
land, fragrant with the blossoming partridge peas.  

The singers walked up and down the aisles of the 
open-air church, working up enthusiasm in camp meet- 
ing fashion. 

"Sistuh Chizzum, won't you meet me yonduh?" 
Sister Chisolm would, so she responded to the mascu- 
line invitation, "Oh yaas, Lawd!" 

"Bredduh Hacklus, won't you meet me yonduh?" 
And Brother Hercules, a wizened little member of Sis- 
ter Chisolm's "class," shouted in acquiescent gallantry, 
"Oh yaas, Lawd!" 

The meeting drew to a close, the last inspiring "sper- 
ritual," of African suggestiveness, remained to be 
sung. Who should raise the tune? Simon Jenkins 
the "squerril" hunter, a devout old rascal, called to his 
brother-in-law, John Chisolm, "hice'um, Chizzum ! 
You hice de chune." 

John's resonant voice rolled out — 

"Jedus, hoi' de lion jaw, 

Jedus, hoi' de lion jaw, 

Jedus, hoi' de lion jaw, 

'Tell I git on de grazin' groun', 

Oh, 'tell I git on de grazin' groun'," 

"HoVum, Jedus!" 

"Dorf turi'urrb loose, Lawd!" 

"Maussuh Jedus, hoV 'e jaw!''' 9 

came the responses in bass and treble, then, as the 
refrain again swelled and died away, "Oh-h 'tell I git 
on de grazin' groun'," an ominous "mmmm, mmmm, 
mmmm, mmh ! mmh ! nmih !" rolled through the woods. 
u Duh Baa y ney! Great Gawd, duh Baa'ney!" shrieked 
the panic-stricken women who scattered in every direc- 
tion, while the men ran to release their hitched animals 
as old Barney leisurely approached, routing sonorous- 
ly. "Mek'ace, gal, mek'ace! Him duh walk sedate but 
"e bex," shouted a man to a leggy, dry-boned black girl 
who, although guiltless of shoes and stockings, had 
worn to the meeting an antiquated hoopskirt which 
now impeded her progress. "Hice'um, gal ! Hice yo' 
'coat en' run/" She "hiced" her petticoat and ran, but 
the crinoline billowed about her knees as she passed 
Dick Smashum on her way to the Savage plantation. 
Dick was duck-legged and as slow of speech as of foot, 
but discretion had urged him to get an early start and 
he was well out of the danger zone. Later, when 
Atalanta's mother overtook him and asked, "You see 
my gal? Wen 'e gone?" he replied. "Uh yiz see one 
sumpnurruh duh run like de debble, gwine Sab- 
bidge. 'E pass me duh paat', en' 'e binnuh trabble so 
swif uh yent ruckuhnize urn 'zackly, but 'e stan' suk- 
kuh two blacksnake duh 'tretch out een one bu'dcage." 

None knew how he achieved his devilmaycare nick- 
name — the only name he had, but everybody around 
Pocotaligo knew that he came by his thirst through 
patient industry, and that he loved his work. No 
round-paunched monk of the Middle Ages, no Falstaff 
of the English taverns, ever absorbed dusky Tuscan 
wine or Sherris Sack with more appreciative avidity 
than Billybedam soaked up the "Fus' X" corn sold 
on the sly by Yemassee blind tigers and bootleggers, 
for Billybedam had acquired his "liquorish mouth" 
during the days, the glorious, honorable days, of the 
State Dispensary, when, under the operation of that 
"Great Moral Institution," certain sons of "Grand old 
South Carolina'' had shown the world that the Cau- 
casian was not "played out," but could, upon occasion, 
graft like any freedman of the good old days of Recon- 
struction ! 

So the bibulousness of Billybedam became a byword 
all about "de Yamassee," where "de Po' Trial" Rail- 
way — significant name — crosses the Atlantic Coast 
Line, and, not infrequently, the tempers of passengers 
bound for Beaufort and Port Royal. 

Perhaps it was the frequent pouring of libations — 
his gods were all in his gullet — that enabled Billy- 
bedam to crook his elbow so expertly, but this facility, 
and a marvelous twist of the wrist, contributed to his 
success as a fisherman, and the greater part of what 
he ate and drank and wore, came from the brown 
waters of the Salkehatchie, whose deep and narrow 
current flowed between wooded banks a mile or so 
away. With rod and line he fished the stream by day. 
and many a string of bream and redbreast perch was 
sold at the station to buy the precious whiskey, while 
the narrow-mouthed "blue cats,"' caught on his set lines 
over night, were traded among the negroes in exchange 
for his scanty food and shelter, for Billybedam was a 
bachelor and a vagabond, unattached and unaffiliated, 
and called no roof his own. 

Sometimes in the spring when the sturgeon were 
running, the fisherman would get the big-game fever, 
and. armed with a ''grain'" which he threw as the 
whaler throws a harpoon, stationed himself on some 
log that jutted out over the water, or in the fork of a 
low, overhanging tree, and took toll from the passing 
thousands. During the sturgeon run, when, too, mul- 
berries and blackberries were plentiful, the negroes 
grew fat and "swonguh" and became more than usually 
irresponsible. 

The heavy, sensuous Southern spring was in the 
air. The bayous or "backwaters," which irrigated the 
inland swamp ricefields, were dotted with the sweet 
white pond lilies, or aflame with the yellow lotus, while 
over the broad leaves of lily and lotus, purple galli- 
nules tripped daintily. Every log that floated and 
every stump that rose above the water carried a string 
or a cluster of terrapins, their glistening backs reflect- 
ing the sunshine. The sloping trunks of the willows 
that fringed the banks were festooned with water 
snakes, basking in the grateful warmth. Here and 
there on tussock or muddy flat, rough-backed alligators 
lay dozing. Blue flags flaunted along the marges. Tall 
white cranes stalked slowly about the shallows, paus- 
ing now and then with spear-like bill poised, watch- 
ing, waiting. 

Billybedam was full of the magic of the springtime, 
but it was not altogether a satisfying fullness, and as 
he pushed the shallow flat-bottomed skiff off from 
shore, he laid down the paddle long enough to eat a 
hunk of coarse corn bread and swallow a nip from his 
"Fus' X" flask. And then, thoroughly satisfied with 
the world, he dipped his blade and, with alternate 
strokes to right and left, pushed the clumsy snub-nosed 
bateau across the backwater to a famous "drop," a 
deep pool just below a gap in the dam where the dark 
waters flowed slowly through from an upper reservoir. 
This was Billybedam's favorite preserve whenever 
high water in the Salkehatchie forced the river fisher- 
men to seek their living elsewhere. 

Today, however, he made an unpropitious start. 
After his earthworm bait had been repeatedly stripped 
from his hook by the troublesome silver fish, whose 
small mouths enabled them to nibble it away piecemeal 
without getting hooked, his cork bobbed furiously, 
and he jerked quickly, only to bring swinging over the 
boat one of the malodorous little black turtles common- 
ly called "limus cootuh" by the low-country negroes. 
This unwelcome catch he disengaged from the hook 
and threw as far away from him as possible. "You 
good fuh nuttV nigguh! Yunnuh fink me come spang 
fnm Macfuss'nbil fuh ketch limus cootuh, enty? Who 
eenwite you fuh eat 'long fish ? You ebbuh see nigguh 
eat 'long buckruh? De debble!" Running his cork a 
foot or two higher up the line, he fished at a deeper 
level and soon began to ha id in fine perch, which he 
strung on the willow withes he had provided. At the 
end of two hours he hud several strings of marketable 
fish, and, as the sun had set, he paddled to shore, threw 
away his now empty flask, tied his boat to a snag, and 
started for Yemassee to convert his catch into cash. 

An hour later, with silver jingling in his pocket, he 
encountered in the dusk, Miss Maria Wineglass, a 
much sought-after ornament of colored society. Miss 
Wineglass was, in a manner of speaking, a peripatetic 
paradox. Altho" dour-looking and glum, she was noted 
for her spirits (80 proof) ; bootless and bare-legged. 
she was McPhersonville's most daring and accom- 
plished bootlegger, and so circumspect and resourceful 
that she seldom met the law face to face. 

When her course crossed that of Billybedam. she 
was traveling an unfrequented path on the outskirts 
of the settlement, and, with little need for caution, she 
walked rapidly, giving out as she moved a faint, hollow 
sound like the subdued tones of a xylophone. She 
hailed the bibulous one as a regular and valued cus- 
tomer. 

"Weh you gwine, bubbuh?" 
"Wuh you got? I gwine 'tell I fin'um." 
"I got 'nuf." 

"Gimme uh pint;" and he held out half a dollar. 
"Gimme seb'nty ft" cent. Dishyuh t'ing hoi' mo'n uh 
pint." 
•'Wuh kinduh t'ing dat? Lemine shum." 
"Yuh him,"' and Miss Wineglass fumbled under her 
skirt and, from a marvelously durable and comprehen- 
sive pair of bloomers made of two cottonseed meal 
sacks sewed together at the top, produced a gourd 
holding about three half-pints, and passed it over. 
The gourd was bottle-shaped and cob-stoppered and  
ingeniously laced about with hickory bark, as flasks 
of Chianti are wrapped with flags. The knocking 
together of half a dozen of these gourds, tied around 
her waist and suspended within her bloomers, had pro- 
duced the xylophone music. The money paid, they 
parted. 

Billybedam went his ways. Whatever the nature of 
the nepenthe the "Fus X" extracted from the calabash, 
it so 'whelmed his wits that oblivion lurked in the 
bottom of the gourd and overcame him. He fell among 
thieves, who stripped him of a new shirt he wore and 
left him, in his trousers only, by the roadside, where 
a local constable found him next morning and haled 
him before the magistrate for being inadequately 
clothed on the public highway. 

"What have you to say for yourself?" 
"Cap'n, uh yent hab nutt'n' fuh say. Uh gone fish

Ever since the days of Solomon, the courts and 
tribunals of the law in all lands have sought short cuts 
to justice, but one of the straightest and strangest 
in the history of jurisprudence was achieved by one 
Daniel W. Robinson, colored, sometime Magistrate or 
Trial Justice of the sovereign State of South Carolina, 
for the Bailiwick of Jacksonboro, in lower Colleton 
Count. 

Under the trying days of Reconstruction in South 
Carolina, the white men and boys living in the 
so-called "black belt," comprising the coastal counties 
of the State, were constantly seeking to lure the black 
voters into the fold of Democracy, with but indifferent 
success, for the wary freedman, under the secret 
instructions given him by the leaders of his own race 
and the white-skinned spoilers, native and alien, who 
controlled his political activities for their own profit, 
was hard to wean away from the idols set up for him 
within "the awful circle" of the Republican fold. 

These poor, deluded negroes, absolutely dependent 
upon their former masters, the landholders, for food, 
for clothing, for shelter, for remunerative work — often 
for free medicines and medical treatment in communi- 
ties where there were no doctors and no drug stores — 
though making profuse lip service for benefits 
received, forgot them all on election day when, under 
the influence of the knaves who manipulated them, 
they turned away from their best friends and, hurdled 
at the polls like sheep, voted blindly the ballots put 
into their hands by the corruptionists. 

At one of these elections the Republican ballot was 
headed with the national flag in colors, swathed around 
the ample loins and spreading hips of the figure of 
Liberty, with the legend "Union Republican ticket." 
One of these flamboyant affairs was secured from the 
printer a day or two before the election and the Demo- 
cratic tickets were also printed in red ink with a 
rooster at the top, in the hope that some of the negroes 
might accept and vote them for Republican ballots. 
One of these rooster ballots was offered an old darkey at 
the polls by a Democratic negro worker, but the wary 
old fellow had been rehearsed in his lesson too well, 
and he rejected it indignantly, saying: "No, man! till 
vent want da' t'ing! Gimme da' ticket fuh wote wuh 
hab de gal wid de Balmuhral sku't wrop roun'um !" 
And he got it. 

Then came '76 and the "Straight-Out" campaign. 
Every white man and boy who coidd raise two or 
three dollars to buy a few yards of flannel, sported a 
red shirt, usually put together by the loving hands of 
some member of his family, but, occasionally, fearfully 
and wonderfully made by a sweetheart or feminine 
acquaintance — some perhaps "a little more than kin,'" 
but all "less than kind." The boys, however, upon 
whom had been wished the needlework activities of 
their lady friends, wore them jauntily nevertheless, 
absolutely indifferent to the want of co-ordination of 
"seam and gusset and band." 

As the campaign progressed and enthusiasm in- 
creased, an occasional courageous black, taking his 
life in his hands and braving the hatred and ostracism 
of his fellows, even of his church and his family, 
would boldly put on a red shirt and ride with the whites 
to political meetings or rallies. One of these, old 
Clitus Wilson, a life-long Democrat, who, as his 
master's body servant, fought with him in the battle 
of Gettysburg, flaunted his red shirt bravely and 
defiantly. Another was Paul Jenkins, a thrifty, prop- 
erty-owning negro, whose courageous work in the first 
Hampton campaign was remembered by the whites, 
who elected him county commissioner soon after 
the Democrats came into power. Paul, a wiry, coal- 
black negro, was once beset by several members of the 
Grant family, "Free- Issue''' mulatto Republicans, and 
cruelly beaten. In the courts of radicalism there was 
no redress for a negro Democrat, but Paul bided his 
time and, meeting one of the Grants alone, retaliated 
so vigorously that the mulatto was laid up for a week. 
The victim went before Trial Justice Robinson, over 
the river at Jacksonboro, and swore out a warrant, 
charging Paul with aggravated assault and battery. 

Paul, summoned to appear on the following Satur- 
day, came in great trouble to a stripling planter of 
the neighborhood who willingly accompanied him to 
see that the Democrat got justice, and to go on his 
bond in case he should be sent up to a higher court. 

On Saturday morning the deep and swift Edisto, 
lacking a ferry, was crossed in a shallow bateau, the 
saddle-horses, held by their bridles, swimming along- 
side, and the accused and his protector soon appeared 
before the august Court, sitting in a small shanty, 
facing an imposing layout of writing materials and a 
copy of the statutes. The young planter told the 
Court that he had come over with Paul to look after 
his interests and see that he got justice. The Court 
responded graciously that he was "glad to welcome the  
distinguished counsel from across the river" and took 
pleasure in extending to him the courtesies of his 
Court. 

A jury was asked for and Justice Robinson, calling 
up some of the idle negroes who hung about his office, 
selected five elderly darkeys, all of them as black as 
crows. To these five jurors the magistrate added "the 
distinguished counsel from across the river," whom he 
graciously requested to consent to serve as foreman. 
In the interest of justice the request was complied 
with. 

Grant, the aggrieved, appeared as prosecuting wit- 
ness, "tore a passion to tatters" in describing the sud- 
den and furious onslaught made upon him by the 
black Democrat, and rantingly demanded justice. Paul 
simply told the story of the attack made upon him by 
the Grant family and admitted his retaliation, which 
he held was justifiable, and the jury withdrew to a 
vacant room nearby which was indicated as the place 
of deliberation. 

The foreman was given a primitive split white-oak 
chair with a rawhide seat, while his five dusky as- 
sociates ranged themselves like roosting buzzards upon 
a teetering bench, whose supports, two short boards 
sawed into the semblance of legs at the bottom, were 
placed so close together that the utmost skill was 
required on the part of the sitters to maintain their 
equilibrium, for if the central section rose, both end 
men had to sit tight until they could rise simul- 
taneously, else the laggard would be in jeopardy. 

And now the jurors were ready for the case. Paul, 
having beaten his man fairly and in righteous retalia- 
tion, was entitled to an acquittal and to this end the 
foreman directed his efforts. As a preliminary, Paul 
was called to the shanty window, provided with sixty 
cents, and despatched to Arnold's store for a quart of 
corn whiskey. Upon his return with the pallid pop- 
skull, there was an excited shifting of five seats on 
the shaky bench and five pairs of eagerly expectant 
eyes rested their kindly regard upon the messenger of 
Bacchus as he withdrew, leaving his fate in their 
hands. 

The lone and crafty Caucasian, playing Iago to five 
Othellos, picked out a gorilla-like old codger on the 
near end of the bench as the dominant personality 
among them, and extending the flask told him to take 
a drink and serve his fellows. Hacklus Manigo 
jumped up with such alacrity, and was followed so 
quickly by the negroes who sat next him, that the near 
end of the bench, relieved of their combined weight, 
flew up, and the two remaining jurors tumbled igno- 
miniously and indignantly to the floor. The grum- 
bling of the fallen and the derisive guffawing of the 
risen, ceased suddenly, however, as eight saucered and 
fascinated eyes fastened upon old Manigo's Adam's 
apple which moved up and down his neck in perfect 
unison with the "glug, glug," of the liquid flowing so 
easily down his throat. The drinker's ocular and 
auricular demonstration of hydraulics was too much 
for his associates, who cried out in indignant protest. 
"Tek'care, man! We'own dey een da' t'ing!" "Cap'n, 
please, suh, mek'um tek 'e mout' off da' bottle. 'E 
gwine drink eb'ry Gawd' drap !" 

Manigo, having absorbed almost one-fourth of the 
contents of the flask, gave it into the nearest of the 
eager hands held out to receive it, drew his coat sleeve 
with a great swipe across his wet and glistening mouth, 
gave a grateful grunt, "umh, da' t'ing good! Tengky, 
Boss, tengky, suh!" accompanied by an elaborate 
scrape of the foot and a low obeisance, and took his 
seat in the center of the bench, where he was soon 
Hanked by the four, whose watchful eyes, each upon 
the other, had not permitted their attainment of 
Manigo's state of exaltation. 

"Now, Manigo, and you boys," said Iago. "This is 
a plain story. Three or four yellow men double-team 
a black man and beat him up. He doesn't take them 
to court but waits his chance, and when he catches one 
of these yellow men away from his gang, why the 
black man beats him to pay him back for what the 
yellow man helped to do to him. Now, that's what 
Paul did to this free-issue yellow fellow Grant. Paul 
is black like all of you. Do you want to send him to 
jail for laying hands on a mulatto, just because mulat- 
toes think themselves better than you blacks?" 

"Great Gawd, no, suh/" shouted Manigo, springing 
up. Turning half way round out of respect to the 
foreman, he alternately jumped in the air and squatted 
like a gigantic frog, while he whirled his arms and 
harangued his fellow blacks, cutting his eye around 
now and then for a nod of approval from Iago. "De 
debble! Punkin skin' nigguh fuh beat black nigguh 
en' black nigguh ent fuh beat'um back, enty? Oonuh 
ebbuh yeddy 'bout shishuh t'ing sence you bawn? Me

"Yaas, man, Jmorl/um, knock'um/" came the cries 
of approval as old Hacklus, having put up his yellow 
man of straw, leaped about as he proceeded to bowl 
him over. 


"Uh yent fuh wait 'tell 'e knock me fus'. Uh gwine 
knock'um befo' 'e hice 'e han'! Uh knock'um een 'e

guh nyuse to blonx to een slabery time?" he asked the 
foreman. 

''To nobody. He was free. He belonged to him- 
self." 

"Great Gawd! Cap'n, all dese'yuh mans blonx to

Paul loose!" 

"Yaas, man, tu'nhim loose, tu'n'um loose!" came 
the chorus. 

"Well, boys, before we go, you'd better finish the 
flask." 

"Tengk Gawd, sun!" ejaculated old Hacklus whose 
mouth was now as cottony as a stump-tailed water 
moccasin's, as he lifted the flask to his lips, "me t'roat 
dry. Uh binnuh talk." 

"IIoV on, man!" 

"Don' te/Sum all!" 

"Manigo drink' too hebbv!" 

"'E gwine dreen'um dry!" came the protests, but 


Manigo had swallowed the lion's share before he 
passed the flask to the next man. "Boss, we fuh pit. 
da' yalluh Grant een jail, enty?" and he was much 
disappointed when told it couldn't be done. 

The jury returned to the Court room with their 
verdict of acquittal, and received the thanks of the 
Court, who assured them all, "and especially the dis- 
tinguished foreman," of his appreciation of the expedi- 
tion with which they had dispatched the business of 
the Court. As Paul and his protector mounted their 
horses for the homeward ride, Daniel stood bare- 
headed at the Court room door, and expressed the 
hope that he might again welcome to his temple of 
justice "the distinguished counsel from across the 
river." 

For many years after the war, Sam Dickerson, a 
former slave of the Horlbeck family, ranted around 
the courts of the lower counties of South Carolina in 
the practice of the legal profession, which he had 
acquired in a jack-leg sort of way soon after his eman- 
cipation. Tall, black, pompous, and as voluble as an 
overshot water-wheel, he cut his grotesque antics in 
higher and lower courts to the intense amusement of 
blacks as well as of whites. He habitually carried with 
him a bag of tawdry and greasy law books, which he 
hauled out and spread upon tables, wherever the space 
was available, to impress jurors and court-room spec- 
tators with his importance. With monkey-like imita- 
tiveness he copied the court-room gestures and man- 
nerisms of prominent lawyers of the white race, and 
he had memorized certain passages from the statutes 
and the law blanks, which he spouted whenever oppor- 
tunity offered. Upon one occasion Dickerson was de- 
fending in a magistrate's court a negro accused of 
larceny. The word written on the indictment pleased 
him and he mouthed and slobbered over it as one 
mouths the pit of a clingstone peach. "Dis man bin 
chaa'ge', yo' onnuh, wid laa'ceny! He bin chaage' 
wid laa'ceny! Wat am laa'ceny, yo' onnuh ?" 

"Do you know what it is to steal?" retorted the 

court. 

"Of co'se uh does, yo' onnuh. Laa'ceny is t'ief, en' 
t'ief is steal, en' uh man w'ich steal is uh man w'ich 
enter anodduh man' house een de dead ub night en' 
did mos' feloniously steal, tek, carry away en' appro- 
priate to he own use de whole or uh paa't dereof uh de 
juntlemun' proputty. But de chaa'ge, yo' onnuh, am 
laa'ceny !" 

Dickerson was so well known about the magistrates' 
courts of the City of Charleston that many prominent 
white citizens were attracted to the trials when it was 
known that this simian-like advocate was going to 
participate in the proceedings, and it was quite the 
thing to take Northern visitors or the captains of 
vessels in port, to the court room to see the black per- 
form, and sometimes the magistrate, or the opposing 
counsel, would be given a hint to stir him up for the 
entertainment of the visitors. 

In a trial before a Charleston magistrate, the black 
lawyer once sought to have a bad case continued 
because of "the absence of a material witness," that 
threadbare plea so frequently urged in our courts. The 
magistrate, inclined to bait him, insisted that the 
material witness be produced in court forthwith. 

"Yo' onnuh, I hope you will not insis' upun de 
material witness bein' produce' een dis co't." 

The court demanded his reason. 

"Yo' onnuh, de material witness am a female en' she 
cannot cunweenyuntly be produce' een dis co't." 

"Why can't a female witness be produced in court? 
What is the matter with the witness?" 

"Yo' onnuh, I hope you will not compel me to state 
w'at is de matter wid de material witness w'y she 
cannot be produce' een dis co't." 

"Unless you can give me good reasons why the mate- 
rial witness should not be brought to court, I will 
insist upon going on with the case," said the court. 

"Yo' onnuh, I appeal to you as a juntlemun ub deli- 
cacy not to fo'ce me to tell de co't w'y de material 
witness cannot be produce' een co't." 

But the appeal to the magistrate's delicacy of mind 
was of no avail and he peremptorily ordered the case 
to proceed. 

"Well, yo' onnuh, my delicacy will not permit me 
to state een de English langwidge w'at is de reason 
w'y de material witness cannot be produce' een co't" — 
just then a laugh from a gentleman of French extrac- 
tion in the audience, caused him to turn his head, and 
he proceeded. "Yaas, suh, you kin laugh, but you 
cannot fo'ce me to use de English langwidge, en' I will 
haffuh fall back on my French." Then, wheeling 
around and facing the magistrate, "de reason, yo' 
onnuh, w'y de material witness cannot be produce' een 
co't, is 'cause de material witness is" — just then a negro 
woman entered the room, and, hurrying up to Dicker- 
son pulled him by the sleeve and whispered in his ear. 
Turning dramatically, he shouted, "may it please yo' 
onnuh, I hab jus' hear from de material witness en' I 
kin now resume de English langwidge. De reason w'y 
de material witness cannot be produce' een dis co't, is 
'cause de material witness hab two twin/" 

On a certain summer day, twenty or thirty negroes 
from the Toogoodoo section, assembled at the office of 
the trial justice at Adams Run station to settle a legal 
matter. The dispute to be adjusted involved the 
ownership of a brindled ox, to which claims, appar- 
ently equally strong, were set up by two black ladies 
from "Down on de Salt." One, Bina Youngblood, the 
"lawfully lady" of Scipio Youngblood, the other the 
lone, though not lorn, Clara Jenkins, for the moment 
unaffiliated. Scipio, the "sea-lawyer" of the Swinton 
plantation, undertook to plead his wife's cause before 
the magistrate, while Clara, having money in her 
purse, because, perhaps, she had just then no man to 
support, had "done git de buckruh fuh write uh Letter 
town, fuh tell Sam Dickuhsin fuh come fuh rupezunt 
me een de co't." At 9 o'clock Sam arrived from 
Charleston on "de shoofly strain," as the negroes call 
the local which stops at all way stations. The ox, 
having caused mutual wool-pulling on the part of both 
claimants, had been put in the custody of the magis- 
trate's constable, and, tied to the picket fence surround- 
ing a corn patch near the station, was chewing his 
cud complacently, viewing with drowsy eyes the 
human turmoil about him. Clara laid excited hands 
upon the Charleston advocate and pulled him into the 
presence of the ox, which she introduced. "Dish'yuh 
duh him, Mistuh Dickuhsin. Dish'yuh duh de oxin

"Come eento co't," yelled the constable, and Clara 
and her counsel went within. 
 

The two principals and their partisans, glowering 
at one another, ranged themselves on opposite sides 
of the little room, and the proceedings were opened. 
Bina came to the witness stand with a slowly healing 
gridiron of scratches covering her face, tokens of the 
efficiency of Clara's finger nails, which courtesies she 
had handsomely reciprocated. 

"Uh gone Wadmuhlaw fuh dig Irish tettuh, en'

With a curtsy to the court and a scornful glance at 
her opponent, Bina retired, and after Clara had 
repeated word for word the story previously related 
to her attorney — for some negroes have the faculty of 
memorizing and repeating a romantic story over and 
over again, omitting none of the mendacious min- 
iitise — Scipio, a stout, self-conscious black, rose to 
match his plantation wit with that of the experienced 
advocate. 

"Jedge, w'en my lady ubtain dis cow f'um de Jew 
tuh Wadmuhlaw — " 

Old Sam rose impressively. "Do my distinguish" 
fr'en' frum Toogoodoo allude to de annimel dat is 
now een de custody ub dis honuhrubble co't ez cow?'''' 
"Yaas, uh call'um cow ! Cow duh 'e name ! Mekso 
me yent fuh call'um cow ! Uh call'um cow, uh dunk- 
yuh ef e' duh bull! Enty roost uh en' hen all two is 
fowl? Uh call'um cow, yaas! Wuh de debble town 
nigguh' know 'bout annimel?" 

"Kin de 'town nigguh' eenfawm de distinguish' 
counsel," observed Sam, sarcastically, "dat he is berry 
well acquaintun wid uh sutt'n annimel dat eenhabit de 
jungle ub Aff'iky, but, on tell teday, he hab always 
obserb dis annimel fuh hab tail. Puhhaps de specie' 
dat roam t'ru de fores' ub Toogoodoo is bawn bidout 
tail!" 

"Great King! 'e fuh call me monkey!" protested 
Scipio, as the audience exploded with laughter, for 
however resentful they may be of such characteriza- 
tion by the whites, in their lighter moments, the coast 
negroes, at least, delight in the exchange among them- 
selves of "monkey," "Vanguhtang," "crow," "buzzut,"  

"blacksnake," "nigguh" and like terms of opprobrious 
endearment. "Da' 'ranguhtang f'um town fuh call me 
monkey! Him g ran/ daddy ''self duh monkey/" 

The magistrate put a stop to these amenities between 
counsel, but Scipio's verbal machine gun was jammed 
and, too full for utterance, he took his seat, muttering 
wrathfully as Sam rose triumphant. 

"Ef it please de co't," said Sam, "I repeah een dis 
tribunul fuh rupezunt dis defenseless female ub de 
Aff'ikin race f'um de paa'simony ub uh membuh ub de 
tribe dat tek Juhruzelum f'um de Christ'un t'ree

"Now 'e duh talk'um!" commented a spectator.

His plea was effective, for Clara returned joyfully

in which she had come, while Bina nursed her wrath 
to keep it warm until she could return to Wadmalaw 
to seek to recover her three dollars '"exwance" from "de

As boys, a few years after the war, we knew him as a 
mighty squirrel hunter, and the negroes in the neigh- 
borhood knew him as a mighty slippery old scoundrel, 
whose smoothness had earned him the sobriquet of 
Okra — at once a tribute and a reproach — for the skill 
acquired in slaughtering "de buckruh' cow en' t'ing' ' 
in the swamps, was sometimes used to lift a shoat from 
some nearby colored brother or sister when Simon did 
not care to hunt far afield, and, however commendable 
one's prowess in preying upon "de buckruh," who, for 
purposes of spoliation, stood in the same relation to the 
newly freed slaves that the esteemed Egyptians did to 
the children of Israel, it was regarded in dusky circles 
as somewhat unethical to steal from one's own color. 

Although always suspected, old Okra was never 
caught. When he killed a cow or other large game, the 
hide, and the head with its telltale earmarks, were 
carefully buried in the woods, and part of the meat 
distributed among his cronies, insuring not only their 
protective silence, but a full crop of elaborate alibis for 
Simon, should suspicion ripen into accusation. "Nig- 
guh haffuh stan' by we coUuh," being the motto on all 
the plantations round about. 

The squirrel hunter was as lean and hungry-look- 
ing as Cassius, with a shifty eye and a face deeply 
pock-marked. His footfall was stealthy and noiseless 
and he could walk the woods from dawn to dusk with- 
out tiring. 

For several years following the war, many low-coun- 
try negroes carried condemned army muskets which 
they bought for a dollar or two — long, heavy muzzle- 
loaders, straight of stock and hard of trigger. 
Although rifled, their proud owners rammed down and 
shot out of their grooved barrels anything and every- 
thing but ball. Shot of uniform size was not only held 
unnecessary, but really undesirable, an assortment of 
sizes running from No. 8 to No. 2, the latter called 
"high duckshot," being regarded as a mixed dose 
seriously jeoparding the safety of rabbit or "squerril" 
at a distance of "two tas' " — two tasks. 

Most of the new-fledged negro sportsmen were con- 
tent to hunt the little cat squirrels that were plentiful 
in the wooded swamps and the oak and hickory knolls, 
but Simon was ambitious and habitually hunted the 
beautiful fox squirrels, grays and blacks, wary crea- 
tures, rarely met with and found only among tall 
pines — sometimes in the long leaf palustris of the 
ridges, but oftener in the great "loblollies" skirting the 
bays, the height of the trees and the Spanish moss that 
clustered thick about their towering tops, making them 
safe retreats, once reached. One of these big squirrels 
would sometimes be surprised on or near the ground, 
offering a shot before he got far up the tall trunks 
which he always ascended rapidly with a great clatter 
of claws on the bark, cunningly keeping on the off side 
from the hunter, but never slackening speed till a fork 
or one of the higher branches was reached, upon which 
he would flatten out and keep absolutely still. Even a 
boy then knew it was wasting precious powder and shot 
to attempt to make him break sanctuary, but not so old 
Okra. He had implicit faith and infinite pride in the 
shooting powers of his old "muskick,"— "Ole Betsey, 
him cya' shot fuh sowl," and he would crack away as 
long as his ammunition lasted, at a gray or black spot 
at the tip-top of some forest giant; often indeed, at a 
dead squirrel, for these "foxes" have an exceedingly in- 
considerate habit of digging their claws so deeply into 
the bark that they hang on after death and are hard to 
dislodge. Often the boy hunter roaming the woods, day- 
dreaming of the buck or big gobbler that was always 
about to spring up just ahead of him, to fall gloriously 
to his little single barrel, would hear at intervals the 
heavy "duhbaw /" of Simon's ordnance and know that 
the indefatigable old sinner was, like most of us, reach- 
ing up after the unattainable. 

Curiosity to learn hoAv he was faring would some- 
times overcome caution, for Simon always begged for 
powder, and his ingratiating "Mass — — so freehan'," 
seldom failed to coax from the flask part of the boy's 
scanty store, but woe to the scanty store if Simon was 
permitted to "po'rum." "Berry well den, suh, you 
po'rum," and into the deeply cupped palm of the 
avaricious hand he held out, the precious powder would 
trickle. Simon never stinted his gun, and as long as 
the donor would pour, the recipient had no scruples 
about drams running into ounces. Whatever you 
poured into his hand went into the gun, and when she 
responded in recalcitrance to a double charge, sending 
her owner staggering back among the gallberry bushes, 
he would grin proudly and remark, "Him duh tell we 
tengky fuh wuh we g'em. Betsey him hab uh hebby 
belly fuh powder." 

One crisp winter's day, Simon and his half-grown 
son, "Boyzie," were encountered on a high pineland 
plateau dotted with a chain of shallow, sedgy ponds. 
Suddenly, from the marge of a pond a hundred yards 
away, the plume-like tail of a big gray fox squirrel was 
seen waving jerkily over the ground as he ran for the 
timber. The party gave chase and succeeded in putting 
him up in a clump of tall long-leaf saplings before he 
could reach the big trees. Simon's eyes shone like 
brown pebbles through the sunlit waters of a shallow 
brook. His slouch was gone and he was all alertness, 
apprehension. 

"Weh him, Boyzie? Well him?" 
"Yuh him, Pa ! Yuh him ! Shum ! Shum !" 
u Duhbawf" boomed Betsey, and Simon reeled from 
the recoil as the load cut the top from a sapling down 
which the squirrel raced to the ground and scampered 
off for a big pine not far away, rushing up the trunk 
in long spirals. "Watch'um, Boyzie! Don' tu'n yo' 
yeye loose off'um 'tell I git Betsey load'," and Simon 
hurriedly rammed down his charge with many furtive 
glances at the watching sentinel to see that he didn't 
"tu'n 'e yeye loose." Extracting from a greasy rag a 
huge copper cap of the grandfather's hat pattern, he 
fitted the nipple and cocked his musket, as strenuous 
an operation as pulling the trigger, for at half-cock 
Betsey's hammer leaned back like the head of a strut- 
ting gobbler, while at the full, the cup yawned toward 
the heavens like the crater of a miniature Mauna Loa. 
Circling the pine he tried to locate the squirrel now 
lying flat in a crotch near the crown of the long-leaf, 
his long tail hanging down while his body was securely 
hidden. Boyzie pointed out the drooping tail. "Dey 
him. pa, dey him, but 'e too fudduh. You cyan' reach- 



'um." 



"Whof Dat squerril? Watch'um!" The piece was 
raised, two sinewy fingers clutched the trigger with a 
jerk that would have disconcerted any aim, and the 
hammer, describing a parabola, fell upon the cap 
which exploded with a report like a parlor rifle, but 
Betsey's muzzle remained glum and silent. 

" 'S'mattuh, Betsey ? You got 'ooman name en' you 
ent got 'ooman mout'? You cyan' talk? De debble!" 
Another cap was fitted, another hopeful aim taken and 
another futile "paow!" echoed among the pines. 
Simon, now having only two caps left, accepted the 
suggestion that priming might help. He also accepted 
the powder which he poured with a liberal hand down 
the capacious nipple and rammed home with a light- 
wood splinter. 

"Now watch'um come down." Another careful sight 
at the tantalizing tail up aloft, another "popped" cap 
with a little blue smoke from the priming, and a sorely 
puzzled squirrel hunter. 

"Witch mus' be pit bad mout' 'puntop Betsey. I 
'spec' 'e done cunjuh." 

"Pa, is you pit any powduh een dat gun?"' 

"Who? Me? Wuh gun? Betsey? Cose I pit pow- 
duh een 'um." 

"Bettuh try'um," said doubting youth, and he did. 
When the shot was drawn and the screw of the long 
iron ramrod clicked against the breech of the musket, 
old Okra's face was a study. "Yaas, ef I did'n' bin 
hafi'uh watch Boyzie duh watch de squerril, I wouldn't 
bin fuhgit fuh load'um." Consoling himself with this 
shifting of responsibility, he loaded deliberately and 
fired, bringing down, with a lot of pine needles, half 
the squirrel's tail, which he stuck in the cord which 
bound his old hat with the remark, "Well, ennvhow I 
git all wuh I shoot at. Ef man kin git all wuh V try 
fuh git, him ought uh tengkful/" 

Lucy Jones, of Pon Pon, square and stout and wid- 
owed, had in her youth been as frequently husbanded 
as the Wife of Bath. One by one, however, through 
death, incompatibility of temperament, or indifference, 
she had lost these affiliations, and now, a "settled 
woman," Lucy lacked the masterful ways and the lov- 
ing club of a man about the house, for it is axiomatic 
among the Gullah ladies of the Carolina coast that 
love and physical chastisement are inseparable. "Ef 
man ent lick you, "e vent lub you/' So, yearning for 
the touch of a vanished hoe handle or axe helve, Lucy 
languished. There was no longer satisfaction in 
"eawnhom'ny"' or "tu'n flour." There was no savor in 
"poke" greens or lamb's-quarter. Fat bacon, while 
greasing her mouth, no longer anointed her soul. Her 
cabin was snug and comfortable, her bed was wide, 
and covered with a patchwork quilt that would have 
made Joseph's coat look like a drab jacket of butternut 
jeans. This quilt, slowly fabricated of all the bits of 
bright cloth — silk, cotton and wool — that she had 
begged from u de buckruh" during a period of several 
years, she had stitched together with painstaking 
fingers and exalted soul, absolutely confident that 
with its completion would come a husband to 
share its chromatic glories. "All de time uh bin- 
nuh mek dat quilt uh bin agguhnize een me min" duh 
study *pun wuh kinduh husbun' uh gwine git w'en 'e 
done finish. Sometime' uh t'ink uh gwine git uh nyung 
nigguh, en' den uh 'membuh suh dese'yuh nyung nig- 
guh ent wut. Dem too lub fuh t'row bone. En' den, 'nod- 
dun time uh study en' uh t'ink uh'll git uh settle' man, 
but uh know berry well uh haffuh git some kind'uh

de quilt 'tell 'e done, en' uh pit'um on de bed, en' dat 
night w'en uh gone'sleep onduhneet' de quilt, uh hab 
one dream, en' one sperrit come to me een de dream en' 
tell me suh me fuh marry Isaac Middletun." 

So the notion got into her head. Isaac was tall, as 
Lucy was short ; Isaac was thin, as Lucy was stout, and 
Isaac was wary, as Lucy was predaceous. Himself an 
elderly widower, he was living alone when Lucy deli- 
cately intimated to him her desire to change the Welsh 
name of Jones for the aristocratic English patronymic 
of Middleton. Middleton, acknowledging the compli- 
ment, politely declined the offer, preferring to keep his 
lonely cabin to himself. "Uh tell'um wuh de sperrit 
say," she said, "en' uh tell'um de sperrit say him full 
come fuh marry me dat same night. Uh hab fait' een 
de sperrit' wu'd, en' uh scour' out de house en' uh mek 
de bed, en' uh pit de tea by de fiah, en' still yet Mid- 
dletun ent come. Uh nebbuh know shishuh eegnunt nig- 
guh. Wen uh fin' suh 'e yent come, uh gone deepo fuh

fuh send wife fuh him. Uh tell'iim uh nyung 'ooman 
cyan' specify fuh wife fuh settle' man lukkuh Middle- 
tun, 'cause dem lub fuh dress tummuch, but seem luk- 
kuh uh cyan' git Middletun' niin' straight." So she 
"took her foot in her hand" and went home, dejected 
but not hopeless, for she determined to stick to the 
trail, as the hound to the slot, until she ran the wily 
quarry to earth, to wit, cabin, for she hankered after 
him with an intense hankering. 

"Lucy Middletun," "Mis' Middletun," how it filled 
the mouth and the ear, and exalted the spirit with satis- 
faction! Ever since emancipation the negroes have 
Laid great store by their "titles,"' prefaced by "Mistuh" 
or "Mis'." Very dear to their hearts was the evolution 
of "Cuffee," "Cudjo" and "Sancho" of slavery, into 
"Mistuh Scott," "Mistuh Hawlback" and "Mistuh Mid- 
dletun," of freedom, and, in the twinkling of an eye. 
"Dinah" and "Bina" and "Bella," the grubs, were 
transformed into "Mis' Wineglass," "Mis' Chizzum" 
and "Mis Manigo," the butterflies. So, as Lucy mused 
and spun the spider web of fancy in which she hoped 
to entrap the wary and unappreciative Isaac, her mind 
crossed the stormy seas of Endeavor, and, resting in the 
snug harbor of Achievement, she thought of the deed 
as done, and imagined herself as going to work on week 
days, to church on Sundays, and to class meetings in 
the evenings, carrying, as appurtenant to her person, 
the longed-for "title" of Isaac, and as she thought upon 
the occasions when on public road or by-path she 
should "pass the time of day" in the ceremonial salu- 
tations so dear to her kind, she was filled to the jowls 
with ecstasy and her eardrums vibrated with the mel- 
ody of "Middleton." 

"Mawnin', Mis' Jones, how you do, ma'am?" 

"Mawnin', Mis' Wineglass, uh tengk Gawd fuh life, 
but you know uh vent name Mis' Jones now. Me duh 
Mis' Middletun." 

"Dat so? I nebbuh yeddy 'bout Bredduh Jones dead.'  

"No, ma'am, 'e yent dead, ma'am, but him hab anod- 
duh lady, en' me hab Isaac Middletun. You know dat 
same Mistuh Middletun lib close Adam' Run deepo? 
Well, she duh my juntlemun now, en' me duh Mis' Mid- 
dletun." 

"Yaas, ma'am, well, mawnin', ma'am,'' and so on. 

And always as Lucy sat in the sunshine before the 
cabin door and smoked her short clay pipe, or in the 
loneliness of night lay pondering and ponderable under 
the quilt that looked like a county map of Texas, con- 
stantly she projected thought waves towards Adams 
Run station, near which abode the recalcitrant Middle- 
ton. Along this main-traveled roadway of the Atlantic 
Coast Line, many trains passed by day and by night. 
The shrill shriek of the local freight, as it took the sid- 
ing at the distant station, reminded her that Middle- 
ton's ears were filled with the same sound. The hoarse 
warning of the Florida Limited at the curve, as it 
rushed southward filled with Northern tourists, who, — 
viewing from observation cars the fruit-laden thickets 
of gallberry bushes covering the damp, flat pinelands — 
marveled at the prodigality of the Southern climate 
that ripened huckleberries in midwinter, every whis- 
tle that blew along the busy line reminded Lucy of the 
railroad, and the railroad reminded her of the station, 
and the station reminded her of Middleton. Theoreti- 
cally, a member of the gentler sex has only to wish 
herself upon a man and the man is as good as wived, 
and the dogma that "a woman has only to make up her 
mind to marry a man and she gets him,'' is probably as 
old as the Creation, for Adam, like the gentleman he 
was, accepted philosophically and uncomplainingly — 
even gallantly — the spouse which kind Heaven had 
wished upon him. But much thought had brought 
Lucy to the conclusion that in her chase of a husband 
she was after all a dachshund, while the elusive Mid- 
dleton was a fox. His defenses having proved impene- 
trable by direct attack, she had tried sapping and min- 
ing without success, even the "sperrit" bomb projected 
Middletonwards had fizzled at the fuse, and her cabin 
and its encircling yard and garden were still, alas! "no 
man's land !" 

In her desperation Lucy decided to conjure ! Like 
old Lorenzo in "La Mascotte," she believed in "signs, 
omens, dreams, predictions," and also in the potency of 
the dried frog, the blacksnake skin and the kerosene- 
soaked red flannel rag, as charms to pull a bashful 
wooer up to the scratch, to put a "spell," resulting in 
sickness or death, upon an enemy, or for any other pur- 
pose suggested by the mind of the one preparing the 
charm, for, a sort of aftermath of voodooism, "cun- 
juhs" are still believed in by many of these supersti- 
tious people. 

Lucy bethought her of old Simon, not an authenti- 
cated witch-doctor, for he demanded no fixed fees, but 
a wily old sinner, a sort of amateur in black magic, 
who gave advice free of charge, although his services 
were always rewarded with gifts of eggs, or sweet 
potatoes, or clean rice. As snake skins and dried frogs 
were component parts of almost all old Simon's 
"charms," the boys of the community frequently 
brought him those they killed or found dead by the 
roadside. These, at his convenience, old Simon skinned 
and salted, or rubbed with ashes and smoked and dried 
and put away, for use when occasion should require. 
The low-country negroes seldom pass a dead frog lying 
on its back, believing that if so exposed for any length 
of time, rain will inevitably follow, and those so found, 
if not turned over to prevent the floods from Heaven, 
were taken to old Simon and added to his store. 

So in the dusk of the earlv night and the dark of the 
moon, for Lucy did not wish the black sisterhood to 
know her business, she locked her cabin door, put a 
shawl over her head and slipped away to Simon. 

The weather was cold and Simon's door was shut. 
She rapped faintly and furtively, and a fierce bark 
challenged from within. Simon hobbled to the door 
and opened it, a black cur growling at his knee. Kick- 
ing the dog away, he bade Lucy enter. 

"Come een, sistuh, how you do?" 

"Tengk Gawd fuh life, Unk' Simun. Uh come yuh 
fuh ax you fuh gimme uh cunjuh fuh t'row uh spell 
'puntop Isaac Middletun wuh lib Adam' Run deepo, 
fuh mek'um haa'kee to de sperrit' wu'd, wuh tell'um 
fuh hab me fuh wife, 'cause uh done tell'um two time 
wuh de sperrit hab fuh say, but him ent study 'bout no

tite fuh marry settle' 'ooman, en' uh done tell'um suh

dletun dat eegnunt en' haa'dhead', uh cyan' git'um fuh

'long'um en' well uh mus' pit'um fuh t'row de spell 
puntop'uh Middletun, en' uh fetch t'ree aig' en' some 
yalluh yam tettuh fuh you fuh eat." And she took 
these gifts out of her apron and presented them to the 
weaver of spells. 

Simon was a man of few words. Going to an old 
cupboard where he kept his store of raw materials, he 
fumbled about and at last drew forth the dried skin 
of a "copper-belly" moccasin, about three feet long. 
This he wound about a smoke-dried toad, to which 
had been added two rusty horseshoe nails. Around 
them all a dirty strip of red flannel, well soaked in 
kerosene, was tied, and the charm was ready. Wrap- 
ping it in a piece of brown paper he gave it to Lucy 
who, tremulous with happiness and excitement, tied it 
in a corner of her apron. 

"Daughtuh, you f'aid fuh walk duh paat' duh mid- 

dlenight?". 

"No, suh, uh yent 'f'aid fuh go Middletun' house. 

"Berry well den, you fuh go Middletun' house mid- 
dlenight tenight. You fuh tek dis cunjuh en' pit'um 
"puntop de do'step to Middletun' house, en' you fuh 
walk easv so him ent fuh yeddy you. Onduhstan'?" 

"Yaas, suh, tengk Gawd." And she hurried home- 

'For awhile she dozed before her fire, and then, an 
hour before midnight, with that uncanny instinct 
which guides those who live close to nature, she roused 
herself? and with her precious charm, set out hot-foot 
for the station. As she hurried through the dark a 
raccoon padded noiselessly across the path. Farther 
on, a grey fox trotted fearlessly in front of her for a 
few yards then sprang into the bushes and disappeared. 
The terrifying shriek and wild laugh of a barred owl 
just overhead, as she passed along a dark aisle in the 
forest, made her heart stand still for an instant, but 
the thought of Middleton warmed its cockles again and 
she kept on her way. At last she reached Middleton  
cabin and, thanking her stars that he kept no dog, she 
cautiously lifted the latch of his yard gate and tip- 
toed up to the steps where, with a silent prayer for 
success, she deposited the precious "cunjuh" and quiet- 
ly slipped away. 

Just at the end of the "dog watch" of the mariners, 
just before the "day clean" of the negroes — the hour 
known to all night workers, when, with the imminence 
of the dawn, somewhat of the weight of the world 
seems lifted from their shoulders — Middleton rose from 
his cornshuck couch and opening his cabin door looked 
forth, as is the custom of the early-rising negroes, to 
scan the sky and appraise the promise of the coming 
day. A gibbous moon of dusky gold, new-risen, hung 
low in the East. Diana had been banting for ten days 
and altho' her waist was waning, she yet shed suffi- 
cient light to open the eyes and engage the throats of 
all the roosters round about, and from the yards of 
lonely woodland cabin, and plantation quarters, their 
voices, shrill and clear, deep and raucous, came to Mid- 
dleton's ears as they saluted the fools' gold of the moon- 
light in the belief that they were heralding the dawn. 

"Fowl' mus' be t'ink day' clean," commented Middle- 
ton, and as he opened the door wider to get a better 
outlook, his bare toe came into contact with the gelid 
snakeskin and he sprang back in fear. Striking a 
match, he lit a lightwood splinter and discovered the 
"cunjuh" mysteriously placed at his very threshold. 
He scratched his puzzled head. "Eh, eh ! wuh dis 
t'ing? Me nebbuh do nutt'n' to nobody. Uh wonduh 
who dull try full t'row spell 'puntop me ! Tengk Gawd, 
uh nebbuh 'tep obuhr'um," secure in the belief that as 
he had not stepped over it, no harm could come to him. 

So, picking it up fearlessly, he put it away in a chink 
in the clay chimney until he should find use for the 
dread instrument which Providence had placed in 
his hands. All day he pondered, for, having no 
enemies, there was none to whom he wished harm. 
At last, as evening fell, dark thoughts came with 
the dusk, and a sinister purpose slid into his soul, 
which he lost no time in putting into execution. Venus 
was the evening star but she told him nothing, for 
there was no love in his heart and his mind held only 
the definite purpose to rid himself once and for all 
of the vexing importunities of the husband-hunter. 

k 'Uh gwine tek dis t'ing to da' 'ooman' house en' t'row 
one spell 'puntop'um fuh mek'um pit 'e min' 'puntop 
some dem todduh man en' lemme 'lone," and walking 
briskly to Lucy's house, where she slept unsuspiciously 
beneath the unalluring quilt, he carefully placed the 
charm in the middle of the top step and went his ways 
under the starlit heavens.  

All through the autumn, when golden-rod and sumac 
flaunted the colors of Spain from every neglected fence 
corner, and the ripening sun burned from the blue 
through the haze that hung over the earth, when the 
crows, uttering their care-free harvest note, flew over 
the tawny fields of corn, and negroes with nimble 
fingers pulled the reluctant locks from the half-opened 
Sea Island cotton bolls, when squirrels chattered and 
barked contentedly among the hickories as they com- 
menced to gather their winter's store, and wild pigs 
nosed about for acorns among the rustling leaves in the 
oak groves — all through these September and October 
days, the boy had pestered old Abram, the most suc- 
cessful 'coon hunter on Pon Pon, to organize a torch- 
light hunt and take him along. Abram White, or 
" 'Bram," as he was commonly called, was a slow-talk- 
ing, slow-thinking, slow-moving old darkey; so delib- 
erate that the mental effort involved in answering the 
simplest question would furrow his brow like an old- 
fashioned washboard. He had been allowed to clear 
up a piece of rich land on Cotton Hill, far removed 
from the ''quarters" of the other negroes, and this field 
he held rent-free in return for the labor of bringing 
it under cultivation. The task occupied old 'Bram for 
several years. First building a substantial cabin for 
his smart wife, Delia, he proceeded to "ring" the forest 
trees and, leaving them to die, slowly grubbed up the 
smaller trees and undergrowth, planting in the little 
cleared plots patches of corn, peas and sweet potatoes, 
increasing his field bit by bit each year. He was 
employed regularly as night watchman for the plan- 
tation and, armed with his long "muskick" — a con- 
demned army weapon — walked his beat about barn 
and stables from dark till dawn, returning from each 
round to drowse near the big fire which he invariably 
made in an open spot, summer as well as winter, for 
the coast negroes are true fire-worshipers and their 
love for the flames that leap and the embers that glow 
is as great as their skill in fire-making. Abram owned 
the best 'coon dog in the community, a black mongrel 
of medium size with a blaze in the face and a white 
ring around his neck. Devoted as he was to Delia. 
Abram's love for "Ring"' was almost as great, and his 
pride in the dog's accomplishments and reliability was 
infinite. The abandoned rice field now overgrown, 
near old Abram's new-ground, was full of raccoons 
and 'possums and the old hunter often got permission 
to put on a substitute watchman for part of the night, 
while he foraged the woods with almost invariable suc- 
cess, and all through the winter the jambs of his wide- 
throated clay chimney were hung with the smoked 
flesh of his spoils, while their pelts — ring-tailed and 
rat-tailed — adorned the outer walls of his log cabin. 

The veteran 'coon dog will rarely follow any other 
animal than raccoon or 'possum — the lawful prey of 
his negro master — ignoring the frequently crossed 
trails of deer or fox. Puppies and undisciplined dogs 
often break away and run rabbits, of course, but they 
are always caught and thrashed and the occasional 
lapse is held derogatory to the dog's master. Both 
objects of the chase are nocturnal feeders, sleeping 
most of the day in hollow trees or logs. Sometimes 
the hollow is high up in the fork of some forest giant. 

completely hidden by the lianas that run from the 
ground to the topmost branches. A dog will occasion- 
ally bark at a tree whence the 'coon has descended, or 
one from which the quarry has crossed on a limb or 
vine to another tree, and whenever the hunter finds 
that his dog has "treed" at a vacant tree, the poor 
animal is held to have "lied" and is given a severe 
whipping, so seasoned dogs make few mistakes and old 
Abram's Ring was always true. 

At last, as October drew to a close and the first white 
frost nipped the potato vines, the boy's importunities 
bore fruit in a promise from Abram to take him on 
the first clear night in the dark of the moon, the con- 
dition being that the boy should furnish travel rations. 
The night appointed proved fine and frosty, with a 
sharp tang in the air, and an hour or two after dark 
the hunt assembled. Besides his single-barreled muz- 
zleloader, the boy "packed" a knapsack filled with 
smoked herrings and hardtack from the plantation 
commissary. Abram had his musket, and Tom Ford 
and Joe Smashum, two young negroes, their axes. All 
three carried bundles of "fat" lightwood for torches 
strapped to their backs. Sike, a half-grown black boy, 
carried himself. All the negroes were bare- footed, the 
horny soles of their feet having become so toughened 
as to make them indifferent to briars and snags. Ring 
wagged his tail expectantly and, like his master, looked 
contemptuously upon the two young curs that followed 
Joe. 

And now they started single file, the boy in front, 
then old 'Bram, the torch-bearers last, throwing a 
flood of light ahead of them, the dogs at heel close to 
their respective masters. So, down the broad avenue 
of liveoaks, the great trees heavily bearded with the 
gray Spanish moss, assuming fantastic shapes in the 
flare of the torches, on across the old King's Highway, 
past the Big Spring and over a low causeway that 
spanned an old rice field. Here the party hesitated 
between tAvo "drives" that seemed equally promising, 
one to the right across the "half moon"' dam to a 
thickly wooded island in the big savanna, the other 
with a slant to the left through a grove of big beeches 
toward the "Blue House" back water. While old Abram 
scratched his head for a decision which "the stubborn 
glebe" was slow to yield, Ring, who had been nosing 
about, dashed suddenly among the undergrowth of saw- 
palmettoes that covered the ground under the beeches 
and, giving tongue on a hot trail, ended his master's 
cogitations. The other dogs followed the veteran in 
full cry. and in a few minutes Ring's slow and meas- 
ured barking apprised his master that he had "treed." 
The negroes shouted encouragingly, "speak, Ring!" 
"Speak tohtm, boy!" as the party pushed through the 
thicket and found Ring sitting before a loblolly pine, 
one of a group of three which grew close together 
with their upper limbs almost touching. 

There are three methods of getting a raccoon out of 
a tree. By "shining" his eyes, which is done by hold- 
ing the torch behind one, and shooting him; by cut- 
ting down the tree and trusting to the dogs to capture 
him before he gets away; or by climbing the tree and 
shaking him down or making him jump off. As Tom 
Ford was a noted climber and the tree was not too 
large for him to "hug," it was decided to climb, after 
the "shining" method had been resorted to without 
success. Tom cut a stick about six feet long which he 
tied around his neck and dragged up after him. This 
was to be used to poke the quarry off the limb in case 
he came to close quarters. He threw off his jacket and 
cap and commenced swarming up the trunk which 
stretched full forty feet without a limb, lifting him- 
self with his powerful ape-like arms and the cupped 
hollows of his bare, horny feet, with which he gripped 
the trunk. In a few minutes he reached the first limb 
and the excitement below him increased, both hunters 
and dogs looking earnestly upward as the climber stood 
on the limb and looked above and around him, trying 
to locate the quarry. 

"Weh 'e dey, Tom?" called Abram. "You shum?" 

"Uh yent shum," was the laconic response. 

Tom again hugged the tree, whose narrowed trunk 
now gave him a better hold, and went up ten or twelve 
feet to the next limb. Just as he pulled himself over 
it and got to his feet, there was a great rattling of 
claws on the bark of a long outstretching limb a few 
feet over his head, and, silhouetted against the patches 
of starlight that broke the leafage above him, he could 
make out the cunning 'coon running along the limb to 
its very end where it touched a far-reaching bough 
from the second tree of the group. Tom yelled, with 
the hope that he might frighten the animal into miss- 
ing its step and falling, but the sure-footed creature 
passed safely and disappeared among the dark needles 
that veiled his sanctuary. 

"Look out, Unk' Ebbrum, look out ! 'E done cross 
to de todduh tree," Tom called, as he began to slide 
toward the earth. The group on the ground flared 
torches and looked anxiously at the new retreat, but 
no shining eyes were visible, and the futility of further 
pursuit of this particular 'coon was realized, as he 
had demonstrated that he could cross too readily from 
one to another of the three sister pines. The short 
chase had lasted only a few minutes and the hunt took 
up its equipment and returned to the Caw Caw 
Swamp Road, Abram, after much pondering, having 
decided to exploit the "Tombs" drive, a noted hunting 
ground. Half a mile farther and the party turned to 
the right and in a few minutes passed near "the 
Tombs," one of the Colonial burying grounds found 
occasionally in the low-country forests. 

The solitary negro will seldom pass one of these 
graveyards at night, and even with companions and 
torches the 'coon-hunters walked more rapidly until 
"the Tombs'' was passed. As they entered an old 
field with several large persimmon trees full of ripen- 
ing fruit, to Abram's experienced eye a presage of 
"possums, sure enough, in a moment, one of Joe's curs, 
with a shrill yelp, struck a hot trail and off they went 
across the big field, followed rapidly by men and boys. 
The dogs overtook the quarry at the edge of the clear- 
ing and treed at a young oak, near whose top the 
torches revealed a big 'possum about thirty feet from 
the ground. As the tree was easy, Sike, the fourteen- 
year-old novice, was given the place of honor as 
climber, and up he went, full of the pride that goeth 
before a fall. Sike was short and fat, and spread- 
eagled himself like a great black frog as he laboriously 
worked his way upward. The going was heavy, and 
having his hands or his arms full, he did not take the 
precaution to look above him until he had almost put 
his hand on the animal. A sudden snarl from the 
hunted, and a frightened yell from the hunter, who 
lost his hold and fell six or eight feet toward the 
ground, clutching wildly at the branches on the way 
down, fortunately landing on one strong enough to 
bear his weight. He did not linger in the tree but 
slid to the ground as quickly as possible, where he was 
received with shouts of laughter. "Haw, Buck! ef 
oonuh 'f'aid 'possum, how you gwine t'row down rok- 
hoonV But Sike said nothing, while Joe went up the 
tree and threw down the 'possum, which rolled into 
a ball as soon as he touched the ground, and, after 
having been mouthed over by the dogs, was tied up in 
a sack and given to Sike to carry. 

And now into the big swamp that stretched from the 
Tombs to Long Life Spring, a noted water-hole that 
never failed in even the worst drought. Ring gave 
tongue querulously once or twice on a cold trail. "Rok- 
koon," Abram laconically remarked, and, as a shrill 
outcry from Joe's nondescripts rang through the woods 
in another direction, "rabbit," he added contemptu- 
ously. The younger negroes soon caught and thrashed 
the rabbit-chasers and, as Ring had now developed 
his trail and was giving tongue more freely, the other 
dogs were hied away to join him and soon added 
their voices to his. The cry skirted the swamp and in 
a few minutes their barking indicated that they had 
treed a quarter of a mile away. The 'coon had taken 
refuge in a big rosemary, whose smooth bark and thick 
trunk presented difficulties to a climber, and Abram 
decided to cut it down. Tom and Joe on opposite sides 
plied their axes vigorously. How many magnificent 
forest trees have been sacrificed since the war by the 
wasteful negro hunters who have no compunction 
about cutting down a ten dollar tree, belonging to 
some one else, to capture a "two-bit" raccoon ! And 
the negro who would grunt grievously if had to fell 
three or four big pines for a day's work, will throw 
an equal number as a pastime, in an hour or two at 
night! Soon the tree began to crack, and the dogs 
were seized, to prevent them from rushing under the 
falling trunk in their eagerness to be on hand when 
the 'coon should jump out of the thick branches at the 
top. They were released as the tree crashed to earth. 
Although they quickly surrounded the top, the wary 
Voon had already made a getaway, but the cry fol- 
lowed hot-foot and forced him up a white oak a 
hundred yards distant. The tree, of moderate size, 
was thickly branched and no glimpse of the 'coon could 
be discerned through the heavy leafage. Tom tied a 
long stick over his shoulder and was soon on the first 
big limb which he proceeded to explore, "cooning" it 
out, while the torch-bearers held their lights under the 
end of the limb, and thus the second and third limbs 
vere explored, but no dark form appeared against the 
light, and Tom climbed to a fork thirty feet from the 
ground. He paused for a moment and looked about 
him, then yelled "Great Gawd, Unk' Ebbrum, duh two 
rokkoon !" 

"Weh 'e dey, boy? T'row'um down!" 
"Dem alltwo dey 'pun dish'yuh lef han' limb." 
"Shine dem eye, Joe, lemme shoot'um," said Abram. 
"Tek'sare oonuh ent shine my'own en' shoot me!" 
cried Tom. 

"Niggvh eye yent fuh shine," Abram replied, but he 
was spared the embarrassment of having to distinguish 
between lom's eyes and the raccoons', for one of the 
animals, a half grown individual, broke sanctuary, 
and, dashing past Tom, slid down the tree to a lower 
limb, from vhose extremity he sprung to the ground, 
unhappily for him, only a few feet distant from the 
watching Ring, who was on him before he could get 
started. There was a furious scuffle for a few minutes 
but the veteran dog soon choked the "coon to death. 

Tom now commenced crawling out on the limb after 
the big raccoon, who growled menacingly and backed 
as the negro neared him. At last the limb began to 
sag under Tom's weight and the 'coon at the very end, 
eight or ten feet beyond him, teetered uneasily, as the 
torches flared beneath him and the dogs yelped expec- 
tantly. The long stick was now brought into play and 
Tom straddled the bough while he tried to pry off 
the quarry, but in his zeal he overreached himself and 
slid too far. The bough buckled under him like a whip 
and he lost his balance, but while regaining his hold 
with monkey-like agility he clutched so frantically at 
the raccoon's end of the limb as to dislodge its occu- 
pant, who fell in the very teeth of the dogs. In the 
fierce fight that ensued, the raccoon slit the ears of the 
younger dogs and mauled them severely before Ring 
could get the throat-hold he wanted. Once secured, 
however, he soon choked the 'coon to death. As mid- 
night approached, it was decided to eat supper and go 
home. 

A lot of dry wood was gathered and a big fire made 
in a little glade. The younger negroes sat around the 
flames waiting for the coals upon which to broil the 
smoked herrings. Old 'Bram stretched out on the 
ground with the soles of his bare feet toward, and 
almost in, the fire, and, true to the traditions of a night 
watchman, he soon fell asleep. The flame;- crackled. 
Tom and Joe and the solemn Sike blinked it the light 
and nodded, the dogs licked their wounds and whim- 
pered at the sharper twinges of pain. Suddenly old 
Abram grunted and "sniffed the tainted gale." 

"Eh, eh ! Uh smell foot duh bu'n ! Somebody' foot 
mus' be duh bu'n! Uh wunduh who' foot duh bu'n?" 
Then, as he sat up and saw the curling smoke rising 
from the thick horny sole of one of his own feet, "Great 
Gawd, duh my' 1 own! Duh my foot duh bu'n! Tom, 
oonuh binnuh seddown duh fiah duh look 'puntop my 
foot duh bun, hukkuh you nubbuh tell me?" 

"Me shum duh bu'n fuh true, Unk' Ebbrum, but 
oonuh binnuh sleep en' uh t'awt 'e would bex you fuh 
wake." 

"Oonuh had no bidness fuh t'awt nutt'n' ! You sed- 
down duh fiah en' look 'puntop my foot duh bu'n en' 
nubbuh tell me. Joe, oonuh binnuh seddown duh fiah 
duh look 'puntop my foot duh bu'n, hukkuh you nub- 
buh tell me?" 

"Unk' 'Bram, I shum duh smoke, but uh nebbuh 
t'ink 'e bu'n bad 'nuf fuh hot you." 

"Co'se 'e didn' bu'n bad 'nuf fuh hot me, but ef uh

fiah duh look 'puntop my foot duh bu'n, hukkuh you

"Me nebbuh shum, suh, uh binnuh sleep." 

"Meself binnuh sleep. Enty uh smell somebody' foot 
duh bu'n en' mek me fuh wake? Oonuh boy' grow up 
sence freedum, oonuh ent wutP'' 

The herrings were broiled and eaten with the hard- 
tack, the spoils were slung around the shoulders of the 
hunters, the fire beaten out, the torches relit, and a 
short cut taken for home. As old Abram relieved his 
substitute at the watchfire in the barnyard, his voice 
rumbled through his beard like the muttering of slow 
and distant thunder, "Uh done tell Mas' Rafe suh 
dese'yuh nigguh' grow' up sence freedum, dem ent 
wut ! Dem good fuh nutt'n' debble^uVuh no'count 
boy, dem seddown duh fiah duh look 'puntop my foot 
duh bu'n en' dem nubbuh tell me suh my foot duh 
bu'n. Dem nubbuh tell me"  

Sabey, a queer, misshapen mulatto, almost an albino, 
with green eyes and yellow wool lighting and thatch- 
ing a shrewd and twisted, though good-natured, mon- 
key face, lived, a few years after the war, on Pon Pon. 
His wife, Bess, a good-looking black girl, was devoted 
to him as a good husband and a first-rate provider. 
When twitted by the other negro women with her hus- 
band's lack of personal pulchritude, she was always 
ready with a retort. 

"Mekso you marri'd monkey full man, BeSvS?" 

"Sabey oagly en' him look lukkuh monkey fuh true, 
but him iz uh good puhwiduh en' no odduh man 
haffuh come een him house fuh feed him wife, en' 
Stepney nebbuh come een needuh." 

Sabey lived in a cabin at the edge of the woods, 
far away from the other plantation settlements, sel- 
dom mixing with the other negroes, who rather feared 
him, having a vague sort of belief in his ability to 
throw spells. When not hunting, he worked, but he 
was usually hunting in winter, and hunting success- 
fully, for although his piece was one of the condemned 
army muskets carried by so many low-country negroes 
after Freedom, he was a good shot and possessed in fi- 
nite patience and considerable woodcraft. Energetic. 
too, his twisted legs carried him for miles through 
the forests and along the backwaters and abandoned 
ricefields where, creeping on all-fours and worming 
his way through cane-brakes and briars, he frequently 
surprised summer ducks, and occasionally mallard and 
teal, feeding on the grass seeds along the margins, or 
the rich acorns from the live-oaks whose far-flung 
boughs stretched over the canals, and Sabey was an 
economist and seldom wasted shot on a single bird. 
On frosty mornings when he peeped over the embank- 
ments and saw green- wing teal strung upon a floating 
log basking in the first rays of the wintry sun. he 
would maneuver and crawl around, regardless of bogs 
or briars, until he got into a position where he could 
line them up, when, after his old "muskick" had 
spoken, he would sometimes gather up a dozen or more, 
which he sold to a de buckruh" on the plantations, or at 
the railway station; but it was as a turkey hunter that 
Sabey achieved distinction in the community. 

Wild turkeys were very plentiful in the low-country 
soon after the war, and in the winter season flocks 
sometimes came up in the live-oak avenues and tangled 
gardens of the war-ruined plantations, making a boy's 
heart thump against his ribs as he watched them pick- 
ing up the acorns just out of gunshot of his little 
single-barrel. In roaming the woods, Sabey knew every 
dog-wood knoll between the Stackyard and Beaver 
Dam, and when, in midwinter or later, he saw where 
the turkeys had "scratched" among the leaf mould for 
the glossy red berries that form their favorite wild 
food, he scattered handfuls of peas or rough rice about 
and returned a day or two later to see if the turkeys 
had taken the bait. If the scattered grain was un- 
touched, he would offer temptation elsewhere until the 
wary birds had overcome suspicion and established 
relations with the rich man-grown food placed before 
them. The bait once taken, Sabey returned at two or 
three-day intervals and spread the feast anew, which 
after a while came to be to the turkeys as their daily 
bread. Then, behind some hurricane tree or old log 
nearby, the hunter prepared the ''blind" — usually a pit 
three or four feet deep, camouflaged with boughs or 
great pieces of pine bark, with a pun opening toward 
an open space where, in a shallow trench, grain was 
scattered. From the scratching ground under the dog- 
woods, a trail would be laid to the trench, which was 
visited and replenished day after day until the greedy 
birds had become fearless and came regularly to their 
breakfast table. Then "one fine day,'' just at dawn, 
Sabey would shamble off to the forest and creep within 
his blind, where he almost held his breath in "watch- 
ful waiting"' for the coming of his quarry. 

Nothing save Sir Walter's conception of the muta- 
bility of the feminine mind, is quite so uncertain as 
the hour of the coming of wild turkeys to a blind. 
Sometimes at daylight, as they fly from their roosts 
on the topmost limbs of the great pines, they go at 
once to the bait. The next day, perhaps, they may 
roam the woods for hours and not reach the blind until 
noon, and on yet other days the fickle creatures resist 
temptation altogether, so "it is well understood" that 
whoso would shoot turkeys at a blind must have abun- 
dant patience and a certain complacent attitude toward 
his own society. 

AVho can tell what thoughts moved through Sabey's 
brain cells as he sat "steadfast, immovable" through 
the waiting hours. Did the tips of Aurora's rosy 
fingers mean anything to him as she lifted the somber 
curtains of the night and ushered in the radiant God 
of day? Did the harsh yet homey "chauw, chauw" of 
the brown thrasher — the first winter bird to awaken in 
copse or forest — take his thoughts to the lonely cabin 
where Bess dreamed of the Sunday calico or the new 
shoes that would follow Sabey's successful shot? Did 
the last hoot of the barred owl as, his night hunting 
over, he slipped away on muffled wing to the thick 
woods to drowse his days away, tell him anything of 
the human prototypes of all birds of prey? They, too, 
the selfish and the predatory, clutter up the by-ways 
of the world, closing their eyes to the light of service 
and the pulsing of humanity about them till, with the 
falling shadows, their eyes open and they prowl in 
quest of the unwary ! 

But whatever Sabey's musings, he crept morning 
after morning into his blind and waited patiently as 
the hours slipped by, for the game that never came. 
Perhaps the wary birds had sensed danger at the 
blind — perhaps they had found a more convenient food 
supply elsewhere — but late every morning for a week 
Sabey had returned home weary and empty-handed, 
but, with a true sportsman's spirit, determined to try 
again. Sunday intervened. A strong superstition in 
the negro's mind, that to fire a gun on Sunday is to 
kt hab sin," kept him out of the woods, and he shambled 
off to church, but four o'clock the next morning, an 
hour before dawn, found him at the tryst which, 
through thought-waves, he believed he had made with 
the flock of turkeys. 

They kept the tryst. The dawn came up slowly and 
silently, bringing in one of those rare windless, low- 
country winter days, when all the air is pale blue and 
gold and the forests are green and purple and brown. 
The first rays of the sun touched with pallid flame the 
topmost boughs of the tall pines and glanced from the 
myriad glistening needles that hung motionless in the 
chillv air. As the sun climbed yet higher, its sensuous 
warmth drank up the white frost that lay like a crystal 
blanket upon the open spaces and the light vapors 
that hung over the dark places in the forest, and. as 
the warmer and softer air fell about Sabey, he drowsed 
at his post. 

The outdoor negroes of the coast need neither watch 
nor clock to tell the time of day. From "middlenight" 
or "fus' fowl crow," on through the procession of the 
hours to "dayclean," "sun'up," ''one,*' "two," "t'ree 
hour attuh sun'up," to "middleday," and then on, as 
the sun slants downward, through "t'ree hour," "two 
hour," "one hour to sundown," and "fus" daa'k," he 
makes a close approximation. So, as Phoebus shot with 
flat trajectory across the Southern sky, Sabey, snug- 
gled down among the dry pine needles with which he 
had nearly filled his trench, dozed and listened and 
dozed, and waking, muttered "middleday-" and dozed 
again. 

A slight rustling of dead leaves like the whisper of 
gently falling rain, and ten beautiful gobblers entered 
the little glade and going straight to the trench, began 
picking up the grain greedily. The sunlight flashed 
from their gleaming breasts as from planished bronze. 
Their iridescent plumage showed all the tints of glori- 
fied autumn leaves, and, as they stooped to feed, their 
long beards touched the ground. A braver sight to a 
hunter's eye than bear or buck or any other game that 
roams the Southern forests ! 

Sabey slowly opened his eyes and stiffened like a 
setter at the point. His long musket, already aligned 
to rake the trench, rested securely in a forked stick- 
driven into the ground. As a sibilant whistle came 
from his twisted lips, ten heads uprose like the armed 
men from the mythical dragon's teeth, and came in 
line with the leveled gun. At a warning "putt" from 
their suspicious leader, they stood on tiptoe for a 
breakaway, but Sabey pulled his clumsy trigger, and 
following the heavy roar, he clambered out of the blind 
and ran forward to find seven great birds fluttering on 
the ground, while the others ran at race-horse speed for 
thirty or forty feet (your turkey, like your condor and 
your aeroplane, must take wing from a running start) 
and, rising on a long slant with a great beating of the 
air, topped the pines a quarter of a mile away and 
sailed off beyond "the Cypress." The big birds, shot 
in the head, soon lay still and Sabey's simian face 
wrinkled with satisfaction. "Tengk Gawd, uh git 
oonuh at las','' he chuckled. "One, two, t'ree, fo\ fibe, 
six, seb'n," he slowly counted — "t'ree git'way." And 
then he scratched his head. Sabey was undersized, 
"him leetle but 'e ole," the negroes observed, and could 
he pack far more than his weight in turkeys to the 
"big house" a mile away ? It seemed a task too great for 
his strength, but his spirit was high, and, as he thought 
of the wildcats and gray foxes that abounded in these 
forests so seldom entered by hunter or woodman, he 
shook his head, pulled out a formidable-looking clasp 
knife and began to peel the bark from a young hickory. 
"No," he said to himself, "uh yent fuh lef none. Uh 
tote'um all ef 'e tek me 'tell sundown fuh git Pon Pon. 
All wuh Mas' Rafe ent buy, uh gwine tek deepo. No 
fox, needuhso wil'cat, nebbuh git 'e teet' een dem tuck- 
rey!" and he quickly removed the outer bark from the 
long strips he had skinned from the sapling and 
scraped and twisted the tough inner fibre into service- 
able thongs. This strong hickory bark is the common 
cordage of the plantation negroes and serves for girths, 
bridles and harness for horse and ox, and is also 
plaited into the long whips used by herdsmen ami 
bird-minders, the "pop"' of whose lash or "cracker" is 
as far-sounding as the report of a rifle. Sabey tied six 
of the birds in pairs by their long necks, distributing 
them as comfortably as he could about his ungainly 
person — one pair over each shoulder, while the other, 
hanging forward, supported by the back of his neck, 
was balanced by the seventh bird hung at his back, sus- 
pended from the barrel of his musket. Thus laden like 
a pack donkey, he threaded the thick woods, avoiding 
as best he could the tangled vines and dangerous stump 
holes, and came at last to the open clearing of "Cotton 
Hill." Here he laid down his burden and rested, "fuh 
ketch me secun" win*.*' Half an hour later he took up 
his load and, mindful of the fact that he had been 
poaching, avoided the direct way through the fields to 
the settlement and, skirting the old ricefield, traversed 
with furtive eye the negro burying ground where, 
shaded by giant live-oaks, seven generations of slaves 
and freedmen slept under the thick mould. For many 
of the far-scattered family negroes still bring their 
dead to rest in these hallowed places on the old planta- 
tions. Apart from the sentiment, it gives them stand- 
ing among the low-caste darkeys who had belonged to 
"po' buckruh" and whose forbears slept in no ancestral 
graveyards. Passing behind the "Echo Oak," Sabey 
reached the big road and, a quarter of a mile beyond, 
tramped boldly up the great avenue to sell "Mas" Rafe" 
his own game. He made a dramatic entrance into 
the yard, his deformed body completely covered by the 
splendid birds, their black beards hanging from their 
burnished breasts and their feet nearly touching the 
ground. The hounds, which had run out with bristling 
backs and open mouths at the unwonted sight, wagged 
their tails and whimpered as they caught the familiar 
scent of the game. 

"Well, you copper-colored imp of Satan ! Where 
did you shoot those turkeys?" 

"Uh shoot'um Beabuh Dam." 

"No, Sabey. Beaver Dam is more than two miles off, 
and I heard a gun in the Stackyard." 

"Yaas, suh, but duh Beabuh Dam uh shoot'um. Uh 
mek uh bline' on da' po' buckruh' groun', 'cause him 
all-time duh mek bline' 'puntop'uh yo' groun', en' uh

attuh da' gang uh tuckrey wuh use een dem dogwood 
t'icket. Meself been yeddy uh gun shoot Stackyaa'd 
w'en uh bin Beabuh Dam." "Mas' Rafe" passed his 
hand admiringly over the glossy breast of the largest 
bird while deftly feeling his crop. "What did you 
bait these turkeys with?" 

"Uh bait'um wid cawn, 'cause uh nebbuh mek no 
peas las'yeah, needuhso no rice." 

"Did you work here last week?" 

"Yaas, suh, uh wu'k Chuesday and T'ursday eben- 
in" 

"What did you do?" 

"Uh beat rice, suh." 

"How much rice did you take home in that bag you 
carried?" 

"Eh, eh, Mas' Rafe! You see me wid bag? You 
t'ink suh me t'ief yo' rice? Wuh nyuse me hab fuh 
rice? Me en' Bess alltwo lub fuh eat cawn hom'ny 
tummuch." 

"You didn't bait these turkeys with rice, did you?"' 
"Who? Me! Mas' Rafe, you hu't me feelin's fuh 

talk 'bout bait dese tuckrey wid rice! Weh me fuh git 

rice? Dese tuckrey nebbuh see uh rice sence dem

"How did the rice get in their crops?" 

"Dem got rice een dem craw? Mas' Rafe, dem tuck- 
rey mus'be bin spang Willtown dis mawnin' fuh use 
een Baa'nwell' ricefiel', en' full dem craw, en' attuh dat 
dem come six mile to de bline' weh uh kill'um." 

"But it is only five miles from Willtown to Beaver 
Dam, Sabey, and six miles to the Stackyard, where you 
didnH kill the turkeys!" 

Completely cornered, Sabey grinned. "Mas' Rafe. 
you sho' hab uh good onduhstan' fuh know nigguh! 
Nigguh ent fuh fool you ! No, suh !" 

And then the former slaveholder bought the game 
shot on his own land and baited with his own grain, 
from the freedman who had stolen both, which is not 
infrequently the way of former slaveholders in dealing 
with former slaves. 

Crook-legged, pumpkin-colored, yellow-wooled, green- 
eyed Sabey — the mightiest turkey hunter on Pon 
Pon — sat in the midsummer sunshine at his cabin door 
and talked, partly to himself and partly to his black 
wife, Bess, who busied herself within. A protracted 
drought was over the land, and Sabey's summer har- 
vest was at hand. Hunting turkeys and ducks in the 
winter, he was equally successful in his summer quest 
for the much-esteemed fresh water terrapins which 
abounded in the backwaters and the sluggish lily- 
covered canals that intersected the abandoned inland 
ricefields. They found a ready market on the planta- 
tions or at the railway station, whence they were 
shipped to Charleston, to appear on the tables of her 
discriminating gourmets in the form of highly spiced 
soups and stews. These big terrapins were frequently 
offered for sale by negroes who surprised the slow crea- 
tures while crossing the road or path on their way from 
one canal or pond to another, or trapped them in some 
shallow water hole. A few negroes even hunted them 
occasionally, the only equipment necessary being an 
empty crocus bag and a pair of legs — naked or 
trousered — with bare feet attached. Sneaking as close 
as possible to the floating log on which the terrapins 
sunned themselves, the hunter crept up until they 
became alarmed and slid off into the water, when he 
jumped in after them, and if the water was not more 
than three or four feet deep he could usually locate 
them by feeling about on the bottom near the log with 
his bare feet, when he would bob his head and his 
hands under, and the prize would go into the sack- 
hung about his neck. But Sabey followed successfully, 
not only the ordinary methods of capture, but during 
dry spells adopted the hazardous expedient of going 
down into the alligator holes after them. As Prairie 
dogs, owls and rattlesnakes live together in the same 
burrows on the Western plains, terrapins are always 
found in alligator holes with their hosts in dry spells 
when the water is low, and he who would secure them 
must either get the alligator out first, or go down into 
the hole with him — one a difficult, the other a dan- 
gerous, adventure. 

In the cruel midsummer droughts that sometimes 
occurred in the low-country, even the wet savannas 
and backwaters were parched to desert dryness. The 
muddy bottoms, ordinarily covered with water, even 
the shallower canals and ditches, sun-baked and 
cracked open, were abandoned by the life that some- 
time swam or waded in the waters now receded. Only 
the deeper places held water, and these roiled with the 
teeming fish and eels and terrapins that cluttered up 
the muddy pools. Crane and heron — greater and 
lesser — flew squawking overhead, or stalked along the 
marges taking heavy toll of their helpless prey, while 
in the mud round about countless tracks of otter, mink 
and raccoon showed that, like lions at the African 
water holes, these lesser creatures, too, held nightly 
carnival at the water. Now came the human spoilers — 
negroes with "jampots" or "churnpots" — cylindrical 
contrivances about fifteen inches in diameter by thirty 
inches in height, made of canes tied together with 
hickory bark thongs, and looking like tall, bottomless 
waste-baskets. Wading in the shallow waters, the fish- 
erman holds his jampot by the upper rim with both 
hands, churning the water in front of him. Apprised 
by splash or flutter that a fish has been trapped, he 
reaches one hand into the cage, withdraws his catch, 
which he bestows in a bag hung about his neck, and 
"churns" again. When conditions were favorable for 
this form of fishing, the negroes, in the years im- 
mediately following the war, caught not only the 
coarse mudfish and "cats" which they so affect, but 
destroyed also countless thousands of trout and bream 
and other fine food fish. In Sabey's time, almost every 
other negro in the well-watered districts owned a jam- 
pot, and the making of this was an important side line 
of the old plantation chair and basket-makers, but, 
synchronously perhaps with the destruction of the fish, 
the art, or the practice, of "churning" passed away, 
and it is seldom heard of now. 

Now that a "hebby dry drought" was on, Sabey 
licked his chaps in pleasant anticipation. No rain was 
in prospect. The roaring of alligators is regarded by 
low-country weather sharps as a sign of coming rain, 
but, although the old bulls had bellowed lustily at dawn 
on several consecutive mornings, the sun still blazed 
from a cloudless sky and the heat waves danced and 
shimmered in the breathless air, giving point to the 
saw that in a drought all signs fail, which was once 
strikingly illustrated by an old-time plantation driver, 
whose master, needing rain, drew comfort from the 
persistent bellowing of the alligators. "Did you hear 
those 'gators this morning, Scipio? That should bring 
rain." 

"Yaas, Maussuh, uh yeddy'um, but dis duh Dry 
Drought, enty?" 

"Yes, a very severe drought."  

"Berry well, suh. Enty you know, Maussuh, suh Dry 

Drought duh him own maussuh, en' him ent Taid alli- 
gettuh? En', Maussuh, Dry Drought him haa'd-head'

suh, but Dry Drought him ent care uh dam 'bout alli- 
gettuh, uh dunkyuh ef 'e holluh 'tell e belly bus'!" 

So, as the unterrified "Dry Drought'' burned about 
him, Sabey prepared to start his campaign. The 
waters, long drying up, were now low enough. Many 
alligators had been forced to move, and the smaller 
ones were frequently encountered in the road — some- 
times even on the high pineland plateaus — as they 
traveled toward the river or adventured in search 
of deeper canals or water holes. They always 
showed fight, too, swelling up like pouter pigeons, 
standing high off the ground, and hissing like 
geese, while they watched for a chance to lash out with 
dangerous tail. But, with the conservatism of age and 
wealth, the big old fellows seldom moved from their 
favorite pools on which opened their subterranean 
holes or burrows, excavated with their forefeet, like 
those of other burrowing creatures. Here in the deep 
pools were fish at hand, and nearby were the pig paths 
along which unwary shoats, going to the water, or nos- 
ing about in the soft earth for succulent roots, would 
often come in reach of the sweeping tail, and add to 
the variety of the big 'gator's fare. In these deep 
underground holes, the ugly creatures hibernated from 
autumn to spring, until, with the earliest warm sun- 
shine, first the nose and eyes would appear cautiously 
above the water which covered the entrance to the hole, 
and, growing bolder day by day, as the weather became 
warmer, next the head, and, at last the entire body 
would be exposed, lying on the muddy bank, or on a 
tussock among the rushes. Here, perhaps, he would be 
descried by some adventurous boy, who, sighting care- 
fully despite his palpitating heart, would shatter the 
'gator's skull with a rifle bullet or reach his heart by a 
well-aimed charge of buckshot behind the shoulder; 
but, barring the boy, the days of the big 'gators were 
long in the land, for they became more wary with 
advancing years and seldom fell to the negroes 1 fire- 
arms. 

While the drought was yet young, the heaviest alli- 
gator in the community had been located by Sabey at 
the "Half Moon" dam, and now the deep pool into 
which his hole opened contained all the water that was 
left in the great savanna. The yawning mouth of the 
big 'gator hole, ordinarily covered with water, now dis- 
closed a parched throat wide enough to have taken in a 
barrel. From day to day during the pendency of the 
drought, Sabey had sneaked up to the pool hoping to 
surprise the 'gator out of his hole and by a lucky shot 
get him out of the way and clear the path to the ter- 
rapins, but he had not been fortunate enough to see 
him, although he knew he was there by the tracks and 
the impress of his great body in the baked mud that 
lay between the pool and the entrance to his hole. 
Even had Sabey found him, he could have slain him 
only with a close shot in the unprotected region just 
under the arm, for the negro seldom shoots anything 
larger than number two shot, which would have 
glanced harmlessly off the tough scales with which the 
'gator was almost completely armored. 

Forced to oust the householder, in order to get at 
his unbidden guests, the terrapin hunter was now 
turned 'gator hunter. Although almost invariably 
hunting alone, pulling the smaller 'gators out of their 
holes with an iron hook and killing them with his axe, 
the master of the Half Moon pool was too ugly a cus- 
tomer to be so easily disposed of, and, after pondering 
long, Sabe}' determined to organize a 'gator hunt for 
the following day and call to his aid some of the plan- 
tation negroes. 

On Saturday morning a dozen negroes, men and 
boys, met Sabey at the Half Moon. They were making 
holiday and laughed and chaffed in high spirits. A 
few carried jampots, intending to churn the waters for 
their favorite mudfish. Others, directed by Sabey, 
had brought strong plow lines which they had bor- 
rowed without leave from "de buckruh'," and three or 
four were provided with axes. Besides his musket, 
Sabey carried on his shoulder a stout seven-foot hick- 
ory staff, at one end of which the village blacksmith 
had attached an iron ring, while at the other he had 
riveted a strong iron shaft shaped somewhat like a 
medieval pike — a spear-like point with which to prod 
and stir up his 'gatorship, and a sharp, though heavy, 
hook with which to drag him out of his retreat. 

Although Sabey was the master craftsman of them all 
in this form of adventure, the two or three old darkeys 
in the bunch could not refrain from giving advice. 
"Git een de hole. Sabey, git een de hole." said old Cato 
Giles, the plantation foreman. "Tek de plow line en' 
tie'um to 'e foot, den we mans kin drag'um out." 

"Dim me gwine een de hole, enty? Hukkuh uh 
gwine git at da' alligettuh' foot bedout git at 'e head 
fus'? Me fuh pit my head een 'e mout' w'ile uh dull tie 
'e foot, enty? No, suh!" 

Cutting a long, supple pole from a nearby thicket, 
Sabey ran it down the hole in order to determine its 
underground course and locate its occupant. He knelt 
at the opening and ran his sapling down carefully, 
listening for the scraping of the far end against the 
rough scales of the alligator. The hole, which slanted 
downward at an angle of 45 degrees, proved to be 
almost straight, and, when twelve feet of the pole had 
been shoved in, Sabey heard the grating sound he had 
been listening for, and knew what work was before 
him. Withdrawing the pole, he first made fast a 
double plow line to the ring end of his staff, while he 
tied another line around one of his ankles and prepared 
to go down into the hole. "Tek off yo' shu't, man," 
advised old Cato. "Ef da' 'gatuh bite you 'e gwine 
spile'um, en' no use fuh t'row'way uh shu't." 
~ "Yaas, man," another said, "tek'um off. You kin 
slip een da' hole bettuh bedout'um." 

So Sabey cast off shirt and hat, and, with a warning 
to his companions to pull him out quickly if he should 
call, went down on his hands and knees and crawled 
head-foremost into the hole, pushing his billhook 
before him. Wriggling like a snake, he dragged him- 
self slowly and cautiously downward, and, about the 
time he had gone down far enough to leave only his 
toes sticking out of the mouth of the hole, the sharp 
point of his staff rattled against the 'gator's skull as 
he lay head on toward the entrance. The strong, 
musky smell of the great saurian would have suffocated 
one less tough than Sabey, but he paid no attention to 
it. and prodded with his staff until he had maneuvered 
the sharp point of his hook under the 'gator's throat 
when, with a quick upward jerk, he fastened it in the 
creature's lower jaw, and, as a hissing sigh met him in 
the face, he shouted and kicked his heels at the same 
time as a signal that he washed to come up. They 
pulled so lustily that his crooked leg was almost jerked 
out of its socket, and his head came out, grumbling and 
scolding, "Oonuh t'ink me duh alligettuh 'long fo' 
foot, enty ? Wuh me fuh do fiih foot attuh oonuh pull 
off clem wuh uh got? Oonuh mus'be fool! Oonuh 
nebbuh pull nigguh outuh alligettuh hole befo'?" 

But they were now too excited to quarrel, and, seiz- 
ing the double plow lines, they began, under Sabey 's 
direction, to pull slowly on the 'gator. Had Sabey 
hooked him in a less sensitive part, they could not have 
budged him. He was too well braced for hanging 
back, but his throat was comparatively tender, and 
inch by inch he began to come up, while the negroes 
shouted and chanted with delight, their excitement 
increasing as the line shortened and the quarry neared 
the mouth of the hole, till at last the ugly snout was 
pushed forward, and then the head, full two feet long, 
appeared as the fore feet followed, and the 'gator 
reared up. Frightened, the negroes retreated to the very 
end of the line. Meanwhile, Sabey had seized his mus- 
ket and executed a flank movement, and realizing that, 
as the 'gator's tail was still underground, there was lit- 
tle danger in a close approach, crept up and, firing 
when the muzzle of his gun almost touched the 'gator's 
side, tore a great hole just behind the shoulder. The 
negroes shouted with joy, for they realized that the 
wound was mortal. But 'gators take a long time to die, 
and they kept pulling, and he kept crawling, until his 
entire length of nine feet had been drawn out of the 
hole. Sabey was wary, and insisted on their retaining 
hold of the staff, which was still hooked in the 'gator's 
throat, and he warned his companions of the danger 
in approaching within reach of the treacherous tail, 
but after awhile, as the great creature slowly bled to 
death, several of the younger negroes walked too near, 
and, while appraising with gastronomic appreciation 
the great tail, which many of the negroes eat with 
avidity, it lashed out suddenly. A feeble effort, but with 
force enough to send the frightened negroes on both 
sides of him sprawling and rubbing their bruised legs 
which the 'gator's sweep, delivered with full force, 
could have broken like pipe stems. 

And now that the Dragon that guarded the treasure 
had been haled from the dungeon and put hors de 
combat, Sabey tied a couple of empty sacks, each to a 
plow line, and essayed a second nose dive into the pit 
of promise. There is always danger of getting jammed 
or stuck in exploring a "gator hole, but Sabey was 
experienced and cautious, and the hole was large, so 
down he went, taking the sacks with him, and soon 
reached the bottom, which had widened into a consid- 
erable cavity eighteen feet from the mouth. His 
exploring hands, feeling in front of him, found a small 
pool of water literally alive with terrapins. Having 
ample room to turn around, Sabey lost no time in fill- 
ing one of his sacks with terrapins, which, at a jerk 
of the line, was hauled up out of his way. The second 
sack held all that remained, and, when this had fol- 
lowed the first, he turned, and, facing upward, decided 
to go head-foremost, preferring to crawl out like a self- 
respecting caterpillar, under his own steam, rather 
than be hauled up by the heels like a slaughtered shoat. 
But, fearing suffocation in the close quarters under- 
ground, he had admonished the men above, who man- 
aged the rope attached to his foot, to pull him up 
quickly at the first jerk, and, as he turned upward, 
his free leg became entangled with the tied one. 
In kicking loose, he gave the line a jerk, to 
which his friends responded so suddenly that they 
hauled his legs up under him, trussing him into 
the semblance of a bronze statuette of a squatting 
Buddha. Sabey yelled with pain and anger, for the 
hole, while large enough for a man to pass extended, 
was too close for him doubled up, and Sabey was stuck 
in the barrel. His muffled cries reached his friends, 
but they thought them calls for more speed, and the 
harder they pulled, the tighter they jammed the 
unhappy wretch. 

"Eh, eh! Da' felluh pull hebby!" 

"Yaas, man, Buh Sabey pull hebby sukkuh alliget- 
tuh." 

It was old Cato who noticed that they had not 
budged him an inch. "'Top, oonuh man, Hop!" he 
shouted. " 'Ee vent duh moobe. Slack de rope." 

As they stopped pulling, Sabey hauled in the slack, 
released his legs, and, hauling on the rope hand over 
hand, was soon at the mouth of the hole, where he lay 
for several minutes to fill up with fresh air. When, 
recovered sufficiently to get mad, he rose on all-fours 
like an alligator, he presented a fearful sight. His 
yellow wool, his face, and his copper-colored arms and 
torso were smeared and streaked with black mud, his 
ragged trousers, water-soaked and muddy, clung to his 
crooked legs, and he looked like a composite of iguana 
and ape. 

Though ordinarily a taciturn negro, Sabey, under 
the spur of anger, galloped through his vocabulary of 
invective at top speed. "Oonuh good fuh nutt'n' deb- 
ble'ub'uh nc? count nigguh! Oonuh ent wutf Uh tell 
oonuh 'sponsubble fuh haul cle rope w'en uh pull'um 
'long me ham, uh nebbuh tell oonuh fuh hauFum wen

home, Bess gwine tek you fuh cootuh, eeduhso fuh 
'ranguhtang, en' him ent gwi' leh you fuh gone een

Sabey washed in the muddy pool, resumed his shirt, 
tied the two sacks of terrapins together, hung them 
over the gun barrel at his back, and prepared to shake 
the mud of the Half Moon off his feet. "Wen uh done 
sell dese yuh yalluhbelly cootuh en' gone een me house

For many years old John, as country coachman for 
the late Governor Aiken, periodically drove a pair of 
switch-tailed mules to the Governor's carriage, mak- 
ing round trips between Jehossee Island and Adams 
Run station, whenever his employer came from 
Charleston to visit the great rice plantation. John 
was a trim and finicky old darkey, with quite a man- 
ner, and, in his old beaver hat and long-tailed coat, 
made a notable figure among the darkeys usually loaf- 
ing about the station. 

Low-country negroes never miss a train. Journey- 
ing by rail, they take no chances, but invariably reach 
the station several hours ahead of train time, where, 
chattering and gossiping, the waiting time passes 
quickly and pleasantly. 

Among these groups old John, with his long-handled 
whip of plaited buckskin, correctly looped, and car- 
ried coachman fashion, moved and exchanged pleas- 
antries. He, too, was always ahead of time, and his 
docile mules, switching their long, untrimmed tails 
about, and hitched to the only closed carriage in the 
community, were always objects of interest to the 
station idlers. 

"Uncle John, mekso oonuh ent shabe dem mule 
tail?" inquired one of a group that squatted upon the 
platform. 

"Sistuh, you ebbuh yeddy 'bout Johossee muskit-

"No, suh." 

"Ahnhn, uh t'awt so. Gal, you ebbuh see blackbu'd'

So old John, coachman and raconteur, a faithful and 
respected servant, lived his days, which were long, and 
when at last he was gathered to his fathers, his 
funeral was the talk of the colored countryside, and 
his grave, ornately decorated with broken bits of old 
blue china and the stone bottles in which Bass' ale 
had once been imported, was much admired by those 
whose sad occasions brought them to the plantation  

God's- Acre under the spreading live-oaks.

A brilliant tropical day in late August, A strong 
breeze from the river moved the glistening leaves and 
swayed the long pennons of gray Spanish moss that 
swung from every bough and twig of the great live- 
oaks, whose spreading arms stretched their protecting 
shade over the plateau upon which stood the Big 
House, crowning the highest point of Prospect Hill. 
A mile away swept the flowing tide of the broad and 
beautiful Edisto, whose shimmering waters, opposed 
by the summer wind, danced and sparkled in the sun- 
light. Upon the lower levels between the uplands and 
the river lay the great fields of early rice, now ready 
for the sickle. Intersecting the fields or "squares" at 
regular intervals, and contrasting with their green and 
gold opulence, shining silver-blue canals ran from 
river to headland. Far across the river on "the 
Island, 7 ' the eye rested upon an emerald expanse of 
June rice which would come to harvest six weeks later. 
From the ripening fields the "harvest flow" had been 
taken off, the squares dried, and on this Monday morn- 
ing 100 hands had gathered by sunrise, for, by the 
mysterious grapevine telegraph through which negroes 
on one plantation hear almost instantaneously what is 
going forward on other plantations miles away, the 
news had gone about that rice-cutting was to com- 
mence at Prospect Hill, and the gregarious negroes, 
deserting the smaller settlements, flocked hither to the 
big plantation where, working in gangs, they could 
exchange quip and jest and gather the gossip of the 
countryside. Some of the best rice-cutters were the 
sturdy young women, who, with skirts tied up above 
their knees and wearing men's wool hats to mitigate the 
heat of the sun, kept pace with the best of their mascu- 
line associates. Cutting and tying by piece work, an 
active hand could readily complete his task, the allot- 
ment for a day's work, an hour before noon, and some 
of those who had walked six or seven miles in the 
morning would knock off as soon as the task was 
finished and loaf around the quarters until sundown, 
while others, pushing their luck, held on until the 
evening, putting two days' work into one. Armed with 
the saw-edged, sickle-like "rice hooks,'' the cutters 
stretched across the squares, each seizing with her left 
hand as large a bundle of the heavy-headed stalks as 
she could conveniently grasp, which, with one stroke 
of her right arm. she quickly severed a few inches 
above the ground, laid the bundle on the stubble ready 
for those who tied into sheaves behind her, and, with 
a sweep of her left, gathered another handful for the 
embrace of the crescent-shaped blade. Down the 
steaming field moved a skirmish line of lusty black 
wenches, bare-armed, bare-footed and bare-legged, 
their skirts drawn above their knees by a cord about 
the waist, which took up the slack. Here and there 
among them worked men. and these, often physically 
inferior to the females of the species, were subjected 
to constant raillery and frequent challenges to equal 
the self-appointed tasks of the women. 

Venus Chisolm and Diana Smashum. two strapping 
Amazons, were the most expert of the women rice- 
cutters, and excelled most of the men in efficiency. 
Scipio Jenkins, a smart young buck, was the special 
butt of the sang of which Diana and Venus were the 
leaders. Scipio was unusually black, with the com- 
mon combination of yellow eyes and blue gums, and 
upon this color scheme his tormentors lit like bee mar- 
tins on a crow. 

"Blue gum, yalluh eye, 
Black nigguh berry sly; 
Yalluh eye, blue gum, 
Black nigguh lub rum." 

Yalluh eye, w'en you shum, 
Black nigguh lub rum." 

"Yaas, tittie, 'e stan' so fuh true. Sat'd'y night da" 
nigguh gone Cross Road'. 'E buy uh killybash full uh 
rum f'um de buckruh. 'E drink'um eb'ry Gawd' drap. 
'E nebbuh gi' nobody none. 'E gone home. Sunday,

injine duh blow off steam w'en 'e duh load grabble! 
De t'ing 'trangle'um. 'E choke! 'E jump out 'e

w'en 'e han' loos'n de du't, 'e feel uh pinetree root. 'E

"e say. l uh done sabe! Uh yent fuh drowndid no mo!" 
En' da' fool nigguh pull 'pun de pine-tree root fuh 
bice 'eself out de ribbuh ! Da* rum do'um bad!" 

Seipio swelled with wrath, but at first ''too full for 
sound or foam," bent to his task and, cutting savagely 
at the thickest stalks, under the impetus of anger, soon 
forged ahead of the others and led the line. Before 
he drew away, however, he projected this Parthian 
shot with a torpedo in its tail: "Benus en' Diana, 
oonuh alltwo duh bodduh me, w'ymekso oonuh ent 
study 'bout Paul? Him duh alltwo oonuh sweeth'aa't 
en' t'ing. Diana t'ink suh Paul duh him'own 'cause V 
ge'm da* catfish 'e ketch las* Sat'd'v, en' Benus t'ink suh 
him duh she'own, 'cause 'e buy gunjuh fuhr'um duh 
Cross Road', but Paul nebbuh buy no frock fuh Diana, 
en' 'e nebbuh buy none fuh Benus, but him buy'um fuh 
Minda, en' 'e duh keep cump'ny 'long Minda, en' him 
duh yalluh gal, en' Paul nebbuh fuh study 'bout no 
black nigguh' no mo'! Him duh fool oonuh alltwo!" 

The torpedo exploded. 

Two dusky faces quickly changed from smirking 
comedy to girding tragedy. Two stalwart forms stif- 
fened in their tracks and stood astraddle like two 
Colossi of Rhodes. Two pairs of powerful arms akim- 
boed, and two sets of sinewy fingers clutched the 
handles of their rice hooks ! 

"Hukkuh Paul happ'n fuh gi' you catfish? You 
mus'be baig fuhr'um, enty?" 

"Baig fuhr'um! Me fuh baig man fuh catfish! / iz 
uh lady, uh wan' you fuh know, en' ef you ha Huh bai 
'lira fuh gunjuh, me yent haffuh baig'um full catfish I" 

"Wuh you got fuh do wid wuh Paul gi' me? Him 
duh yo" 1 juntlemun, enty?" 

"Ef 'e yent my'own, uh know berry well suh him 
ent fuh blonx to no black nigguh lukkuh you !" 

"Nigguh! Who you call nigguh? De Debbie is uh 
nigguh" 

"Him duh nigguh fuh true, but dis ricefiel' full uh 'e 
chillun, en' 'e gran'chillun alltwo, en' uh 'spec' you dull 
one uh 'e gran'!" 

A shriek of laughter from Scipio filled Diana's cup 
of anger to overflowing, and, with a savage rice- 
cutting swing, she sideswiped Venus with her saw- 
edged sickle, and cut her acquaintance below, and 
behind, the belt. Bustles were not then worn, but the 
victim was saved from a most inconvenient wound by 
the folds of her looped-up skirt, which, like a furled 
sail, hung just abaft the beam, and she received only a 
scratch. Starting at the scratch, however, Diana was 
twenty feet away and going strong when Venus, yell- 
ing with pain, turned and gave chase. Screams of 
laughter mingled with shouts of excitement, as Diana 
tripped and fell on the stubble, and Venus, too close to 
check her speed, stumbled over her prostrate assailant 
and came a cropper, the rice hook flying out of her 
hand as she fell. Diana's weapon, having been taken 
from her by one of the men, the two ladies were on 
equal terms with nature's weapons, and, both being on 
all-fours, literally and figuratively, they soon fastened 
their "ten commandments" in each other's wool. They 
fought viciously and silently, and not until, collapsed 
from exhaustion, they had been separated by the men, 
did they again become vocal. Venus' gingham skirt 
had suffered a cruel rent. As she reached behind her 
and felt the yawning gap in her .sartorial hinterland, 
and realized the ignominy that had been put upon her 
by this "most unkindest cut of all," she shrieked in 
anger. "Uh gwine tek you Trial Jestuss ! You f uh 
gone Adam' Eun fuh dis t'ing wuh you done do!" and 
she flung wrathfully out of the field. Out of the babel 
of voices that arose among the partisans of the two 
goddesses, the dominant note was abuse of Scipio, who 
had flung Paul, the apple, or rather the Guinea squash. 
of discord among them. 

"Wuh you haffuh do 'long Paul' name? Ef him iz 
buy gunjuh en' frock en' t'ing fuh free 'ooman', uh 
sho' 'e mo' bettuh den fuh nebbuh buy nutt'n' fuh

of a free spender. "Wuh you ebbuh buy fuh 'ooman? 
Eb'ry Sat'd'y night da' buckruh' sto* duh Cross Road' 
full up wid 'ooman, en' you ebbuh buy uh tencent wut'

"Yaas, tittie ! You talk trute ! 'Ooman redduh hab

talk!" 

"Him lub'um alltwo," observed a sapient one. "Him 
mout' en' him yez alltwo fuh full one time!" 



On the second Saturday thereafter, having been 
summoned by Big Jim Green, the negro constable. 
Venus and Diana, with their respective satellites, 
appeared before the Trial Justice at Adams Run sta- 
tion, where Diana, duly indicted, was charged in the 
comprehensive phraseology of the Criminal Code with 
such a string of offenses against the peace and dignity 
of the State of South Carolina and the proper person 
of Venus Chisolm that her ears tingled and her eyes 
popped with amazement. 

"Guilty or not guilty?" 

"Uh yent know wuh you call so, Jedge, but uh neb- 
buh do none uh dem t'ing wuh da' papuh call dem

'cause ef uh had'uh cut'um fuh true, true! da' 'ooman 
would 'uh haffuh stan'up 'puntop'uh 'e two foot fuh

"Received as information," observed the magistrate, 
and he called Venus, who came up smiling. "You have 
heard Diana's story. What have you to say?" 

"Uh yeddy'um, suh. But 'e cut me." 

"Where did she cut you?" 

"Suh?" 

"Where did she cut you?" 

" 'E cut me een Mas' Edwu'd' ricefieP, suh." 

"Yes, I know you were all in the ricefield, but where 
did she cut you?" 

" R cut me een ten acre, suh." 

"Cut you in ten acre!" 

" 'E cut me een da' ten acre square wuh stan' close to 
de baa'nyaa'd, suh." 

"Well, you have given the location in the ricefield, 
now, where on your person did Diana cut you with a 
rice hook?" 

"Suh?" 

"Your person is your body. Did she cut vou on your 
body?" 

"Yaas, suh, *e cut me." 

"Well, on what part of your body did she cut you '." 

"Da' same place wuh you call 'e name, suh." 

"What place?" 

" 'E cut me on me pussmi, suh, en', Jedge, de t'ing 
sweet V me so bad, ef uh could'uh ketch da' *ooman 'fo' 
uh ketch me foot en' fall obuhr'um, da' '00111:111 would 
uh dead!" 

As there was murderous intent in the sudden heat 
and passion of both Venus and Diana, the court 
imposed upon the defendant a fine only sufficient to 
rehabilitate the wardrobe of the prosecuting witness, 
who sailed out of court thoroughly satisfied with the 
new frock in prospect and the present enrichment of 
her vocabulary by the buckra word "pussun." 

The "Dower House," which Abram Drayton had 
inherited from his father, old John, now resting under 
the great live-oaks of the plantation burying ground, 
was quite a pretentious affair, two stories high, with 
two chimneys and a leak. The stories were not very 
high, only six or seven feet in the clear, but it was 
sometimes convenient to be able to reach up and touch 
the ceiling, and, after all, it was a two-story house and, 
like all two-story houses among the negroes, added 
greatly to the prestige of the owner's family. In the 
usual one-story negro cabin, the boarded-over "loft," 
reached by ladder, is at once the sleeping room for the 
children, the granary for corn and peas, and the hay 
mow for whatever straw or fodder the householder 
possesses, but the Dower House had a real second story, 
attained by steps, narrow and teetering 'tis true, which 
the ascending biped usually "cooned" on all-fours, but 
they were steps, not rungs, and, however vigorously 
the negro expresses in hymns and spirituals his will- 
ingness, indeed anxiety, to "climb up Jacob's ladder," 
in the present life he prefers the creak of a boafd 
under his foot. 

Under the law of primogeniture, arbitrarily estab- 
lished by old John for the disposition and control of 
his landed property, the "Two-Chimbly House" was 
bequeathed by word of mouth to his eldest son, and 
similarly settled upon his eldest grandson, and so on, 
as long as the line lasted, or until the shingles fell off, 
when dynastic difficulties would inevitably intervene. 
Perhaps he had heard of primogeniture and dower 
houses while waiting at the table of his English-bred 

master in the old times, but however the idea came into 
his kinky head, once in, it stuck, and he determined 
that a Dower House he would leave, and a Dower 
House entailed. "Uh gwine tie de 'tail 'puntop da' 
house fuh hol'um fas'! Uh tie'um fus" 'puntop my boy, 
Ebbrum, en" den 'e fuh tie 'puntop him boy, my gran', 
en* de 'tail ent fuh tek'off ! De 'tail ent fuh tie 'pun- 
top no 'ooman. 'Ooman ent fuh hab no house. Man 
fuh hab'um en' him fuh hol'um, so him kin fetch de 
'ooman to "e han'!" 

So, the " 'tail" still tied to Abram, in due time he 
came into the Dower House, and here, in the woods on 
the road from Adams Run Station to Caw Caw 
Swamp, he lived and reared a family. 

At the tail of the summer his wife partook "not 
wisely but too well" of watermelon and buttermilk, 
and through the unfortunate combination was forth- 
with translated from the bosom of Abram to that of 
Abraham. The widowed man resigned himself to the 
will of the Lord, and accepted his bereavement not the 
less philosophically that his crop was already made 
and partly gathered. u Ef de Lawd haft'uh tek'um, uh 
glad 'E vent tek'um "tell de crap done mek." he 
reflected gratefully and reverently. In a week he had 
picked and sold the last of his cotton, and out of the 
proceeds outfitted his old mare with a new saddle, 
bridle and cloth, notwithstanding which, the ungrate- 
ful creature, with true feminine perversity, "gone en' 
leddown en' dead, jis' 'cause uh yent feed'um fuh two'- 
t'ree day. Uh nebbuh know da' mare gwine hongry 
to dat! 'E hongry 'tell 'e dead, en' now uh haffuh tek 
me two foot en' walk!"  

Abram, being now more than a "settled" man, jogged 
along in single harness uneventfully for several 
months. "Not so young, sir, to love a woman for sing- 
ing, nor so old as to dote on her for anything," he now, 
in the autumn of his days, became somewhat critical 
in the matter of feminine needlework. His grown 
daughter esteemed herself a competent, almost a skil- 
ful, patcher of broken, frayed or frazzled raiment. 
She knew very well how to put crocus or burlap 
patches on the knees of the jeans or blue denim trousers 
affected by her sire, but though she could attach them 
in such fashion that they would hold, the edges always 
overlapped like the strakes of a clinker-built whale 
boat. But whatever these patches lacked in symmetri- 
cal attachment, they served well enough, for, as Abram 
advanced in years, he did not kneel so often as he sat. 
The seats of his trousers, however, yawned in pathetic 
neglect for, however acceptably his daughter repaired 
his broken knees, the half-soling of the seats was a 
much more serious matter, which she lacked the high 
spirit to undertake, and he carried about with him, 
whithersoever he went, gaping wounds in his sartorial 
equipment where, according to Hudibras, "a kick in 
that part more hurts honor than deep wounds before." 
Not that anyone would ever have kicked him, for he 
was of a quiet and inoffensive disposition. 

Most observers of humanity have noted with interest 
the close resemblance of certain types of the "wild (and 
tame) animals one has known." The horse, the ass, 
the bulldog, the pug, sheep and goat, fox, raccoon and 
rat, the 'possum, grinning with pious hypocrisy, and 
the Berkshire pig with slanting eyes and champing- 
jowls, are all marked likenesses frequently reproduced 
in human faces, representing the stupid, the sly, the 
selfish, the grasping, the predaceous, the stubborn, the 
sensual, the combative, the treacherous — all of them 
to be avoided, or warily appraised, for the good of 
one's soul — and of one's pocket, Unhappily, those who 
have been blessed with so rich an experience as to have 
suffered both fools and knaves, seldom learn to read 
the buoys with which nature has wisely marked the 
dangerous reefs in her physiognomonic charts, until 
the keels of their craft grind upon the rocks! But 
Abram's face was that of the mild-eyed, introspective 
ox. There was no militant personality in the neigh- 
borhood to "walk a mile out of his way to kick a 
sheep,'' and, even had there been, to have kicked Abram 
would have been anatomically impossible, for the 
unsportsmanlike may shoot a sitting bird, but he can- 
not kick (offensively) a sitting man, and Abram was 
usually sitting! So, having held inviolate against the 
insulting toe the seats of his trousers, which he had 
lost only through the slow attrition of honest sloth, he 
retained his self-respect, though he was a peripatetic 
scandal whenever he went abroad upon his "peaceful 
occasions." With praiseworthy propriety, he now came 
in late to church or prayer-meeting, and, a vigorous 
and devout "class leader," coached his class from the 
bench, dreading the publicity of the sidelines. Then he 
sat discreetly at the close of the services until "de 
'ooman en' t'ing" had gained an offing and sailed away, 
when, as he showed a fairly presentable front, he 
would follow after them and engage in long distance 
conversation. 

"Come on, Bredduh Drayton. Mekso you walk so 
slow?" 


"Uh haffuh walk slow, tittie, 'cause dese debble'ub'- 
uh britchiz bus', en' dem ent wut. Da' gal uh my'own 
able fuh pit uh berry deestunt patch 'puntop de knee, 
but seem lukkuh him ent able fuh do nutt'n' 'long de

fuh man fuh seddown een'um, but dem cyan' specify

"Wuh mekso you ent tek anodduh lady fuh wife? 
You got big house en' 'nuf groun' fuh mek crap, 
mekso you ent fuh hab ooman?" 

"Uh hab house en' groun,' fuh true. Uh got uh 
two-chimbly house, but 'ooman shishuh onsaa't'n t'ing, 
uh kinduh 'f'aid fuh tek anodduh chance. Ebbuh

"Yaas, my Bredduh, you binnuh seddown, fuh 
true!" a church sister laughingly retorted. "Da' de 
reas'n w'ymekso you shame' fuh stan'up fuh lead yo' 
class ! Long seddown mek short stan'up, you know." 

"Go 'way, gal ! 'Nuf man wuh hab wife een dem 
house, dem britchiz ent able fuh specify. Dem wife 
lazy tummuch fuh patch'um." And so Abram, always 
backward in company, put on the best front he could 
for a Avhile and, unlike Edward Bellamy, never looked 
behind him. At last the raillery told on him, however, 
and he made up his mind to take another plunge into 
the roiling waters of married life. Not the "uncertain 
sea of matrimony" beloved of poets, but just the black 
and sluggish current of the branch or run, in which, 
among snags and cypress knees, swam the slimy catfish 
and the venomous moccasin. The hazard was not 
great, for, however forbidding they looked, the waters 
were shallow, and the low-country negro, stepping into 
matrimony, keeps at least one big toe on dry ground, 
and. if one steps in the wrong place, one can always 
step out again, and try elsewhere. So, with more than 
a toe-hold of mental reservation, Abram at last, like 
the storied frog, ''would a wooing go" — and he went. 
"Uh gwine Cross Road'. Uh gwine Sat'd y night w'en 
'nuf ooman dey dey, en' uh gwine saa'ch dem eb'ry 
Gawd' one 'tell uh git one wuh kin specify. Uh yent 
wan' no settle' 'ooman, 'cause dem done hab 'nuf man

gal fuh wife, wuh ent know nutt'n', uh kin bruk'um 
fuh suit, same lukkuh oxin bruk fuh pull plow. Uh 
kin fetch'um onduhneet' me han'!"' 

With these masterful masculine reflections, Abram 
went his ways to the Cross Roads, and having, like 
Poe's Raven, acquired the sitting habit, down he sat 
near the store on a convenient log which offered :it 
once rest for his weary bones and camouflage for his 
sartorial infirmities. For an hour or more he watched 
with an appraising eye the women coming and going, 
acknowledging the salutations of those who passed 
near him. At last, his approving regard rested upon 
what the antebellum advertisements would have called 
a "likely girl" who curtseyed as she came opposite him. 
"Come'yuh, gal," he called. "Wuh you name?"' 

"Sukey, suh." 

"You duh An' Minda' gal. enty?" 

"Yaas, suh, him dull my Grumma en' me dull him

'You onduhstan' 'bout cook en' wash, enty?" 

"Yaas, suh, uh well acquaintun wid alltwo." 

"Berry well. You know how fuh patch man'

"No, suh, uh know how fuh patch ooman' frock, 
but uh yent know nutt'n' 'bout no britchiz 'cause none

"You hab Pa, enty?" 

"No, suh, uh yent hab no Pa. Uh yeddy 'bout'um 
but uh nebbuh shum. Grumma tell me suh one time uh

"You tek attuh yo' Pa, enty?" 

"Yaas, suh, uh nebbuh shum, but eb'rybody say suh

"You ent tek attuh yo' Ma, iz you?" 

"No, suh, uh yent tek attuh him." 

"Berry well, uh gwine hab you fuh wife. You know

tell yo' Grumma uh gwine fuh shum Sunday night full 
tell'um uh gwine hab you fuh wife." 

"Yaas, suh. Well, good ebenin', suh," and, with 
another curtsy, she was gone. 

But Abram's plans they gang'd agley, for old John, 
in putting the word-of-mouth entail on the Dower 
House, had tied the " 'tail" so loosely that its terms and 
conditions were constantly subject to family discus- 
sion and interpretation, and Abram's son now objected 
to his father's marriage, believing that it would break 
the entail and deprive him of the right of succession 
to "de Two-Chimbly House." "Wen Grumpa him tie 
de 'tail 'puntop de house, 'e say 'sponsubble suh 'e yent 
full tek off, en' suh 'e yent fuh tie 'puntop no 'ooman. 
Pa ent know uh Gawd" t'ing 'bout da' gal him dull talk

His daughter sought to comfort Abram, who. in the 
short space of 30 hours, had loved and wooed, and won 
and lost, "Nemmine', Pa, you got yo' Two-Chimbly 
House." 

"Yaas, but uh cyan' seddown befo' alltwo de chim- 
bly one time." 
 

For many years after freedom came to the negroes 
of the low-country, they were cruelly and ignobly 
cheated by the tradespeople who set up little Cross 
Roads stores in even' community. Many of these were 
German corner-shopkeepers from the cities. Others 
were wandering Jews, whose predatory instincts took 
them wherever there were pickings to be had. Yet 
others, to their shame, were certain low-class South 
Carolinians that did not scruple to take advantage of 
the ignorant freedmen who, a wasteful and improvi- 
dent people, whose needs had all been supplied under 
slavery, squandered the money they were unaccus- 
tomed to handling and unable to compute. 

Imitative as monkeys, however, it is to the credit of 
their intelligence, if not of their morality, that they 
soon learned to retaliate, and many a brick and rusty 
plowshare was weighed in their bags of seed cotton 
and paid for by the tricky shopkeeper who, knowing 
that in many cases the cotton was stolen from the 
planter for whom the negro worked, and brought 
stealthily by night to the sophisticated merchant, did 
not scan his purchase too closely, and many an ancient 
nest Ggg, too, was sold to the shopkeeper as a new-laid 
"yaa'd aig" and shipped away to city customers. 

The marks upon the brass beams of the ^.counter- 
scales with which the negroes' purchases were weighed, 
were so obscured and tarnished that they could not be 
deciphered, even by customers who could read, but the 
wily shopman knew exactly where to put his weight 
to give a twelve-ounce pound, which is what the negro 
usually got. Always suspecting "de buckruh" of cheat- 
ing him, and being unable to do even the smallest addi- 
tion, the negro soon learned to protect himself, if not 
from short weights, at least from short change, and it 
was interesting to observe a shopper making her week's 
purchases on Saturday nights at one of these neighbor- 
hood stores. The women, commonly more alert, and 
always more suspicious, than the men, were usually 
charged with the buying. If a customer had a dollar 
to spend, she would first price the various commodities 
under consideration. 

"Hummuch you ax full sugar?" 

"Ten cents a pound." 

'Ten cent' uh poun'?" 

"Yes." 

"Hummuch fuh fibe cent'?" 

"Half a pound." 

"Gimme fibe cent' wut." 

The short-weight sugar wrapped up and handed 
out, the customer would draw it to her bosom and. 
leaning on the counter, put her protecting arms around 
it. The dollar, ceremonially unwrapped from a corner 
of her apron, would be handed over, and ninety-five 
cents in change returned, which she would count over 
carefully before proceeding with her next purchase. 

"You got any bakin'?" 

"Yes." 

"Wuh kind'uh bakin?" 

"Side meat and shoulder meat." 

"Hummuch fuh him?" 

"Ten cents for the shoulders and twelve and a half 
cents for the sides." 

"Gimme ten cent' wut uh side meat." 


When that was delivered, ten cents would be slowly 
taken from the little pile and paid over. 

"Wuh kinduh clawt' you got?" 

"Homespun, gingham, calico. What kind you 
want?" 

"Lemme shum." 

Bolts of each would be placed before her. 

"Hummuch da' speckly kin'?" (pointing to the ging- 
ham). 

"Ten cents a yard." 

"Gimme ten cent' wut." 

A thirty-three-inch yard would be torn off. 

"You got any salt?" 

"Yes." 

"Hummuch fuh him?" 

"Five cents a quart." 

"Gimme t'ree cent' wut." 

"You got any flour?" 

"Yes." 

"Hummuch you ax fuh him?" 

"Five cents a pound." 

"Gimme ten cent' wut." 

The flour and the salt would come within the encir- 
cling arms, fifteen cents be counted out, and all trans- 
actions suspended until the two cents change was 
returned to her. 

"Wuh kinduh tubackuh you got?" 

Two or three samples of plug tobacco^ the only sort 
in common use, would be offered for inspection, and 
perhaps the advice of a colored sister asked before 
deciding upon a selection. 

By the time the dollar was expended, the clerk had 
walked a hundred yards or so, had used up lots of 
brown paper and paper twine and had had his patience 
sorely tried, but he charged liberally for his time and 
trouble, and the poor darkey got far less than she paid 
for. 

In the funny columns of Northern periodica!-, and 
in the immemorial minstrel jokes and songs, the negro 
not only steals chickens, but eats them. The low-coun- 
try negroes, however, while all of them keep chickens. 
seldom, if ever, eat them, the coarsest fat bacon being 
far more to the negro's taste than the juiciest broiler. 
Then, too, eggs and chickens are currency in most 
negro communities and can always be converted into 
cash at the country store or at the back door of the 
nearest white family. 

The country negroes on the coast still speak of 
'fo'punce" chickens and '"seb'npunce" chickens, mean- 
ing the sizes that were sold for four pence and seven 
pence respectively before the Revolution, when British 
coinage was the currency of the country. 

"Gal, ketch da' seb'npunce ehickin en* dem t'ree 
fo'punce ehickin' en tek dese'yuh six aig', en' tek'um to

'bout w'en de ground en' t'ing wet, en' moccasin does 
folluhr'um fuh ketch'um, en' uh yent wan' you fuh git 
'structed by no snake duh paat'." 

The little girl leaned on the counter, slowly unrolled 
an old bandanna handkerchief, and spread the six eggs 
before her, carefully keeping the unhappy chickens 
concealed in her apron. 

"Ebenin', suh. Ma tell me fuh git uh plug'uh 
tubackuh wid dese aig'." 

"You can get only half a plug for half a dozen eggs. 
Eggs are ten cents a dozen ! " 

"Yaas'suh, but Ma tell me fuh git'uh whole plug," 
said the shrewd little trader. "Ma tell me fuh ax you 
ef you ent g'em uh whole plug uh tubackuh fuh de six 
aig', please, suh, fuh gimme uh gunjuh — tengky, suh." 
as the obliging clerk handed her a big scalloped 
molasses cake and short-cut the plug of tobacco enough 
to pay for it. 

The tobacco trade consummated, the girl fumbled 
furtively in her apron, and, feeling about deftly, 
located and drew forth the "seb'npunce" chicken. That 
adolescent fowl, a rooster whose voice was changing, 
alternately peeped and squawked, as the seller with 
out-stretched arm dangled him by the legs high over 
the counter, his outspread wings making him look a 
full size larger, but the shopkeeper was country-bred, 
and felt the rooster's breastbone. "Fifteen cents," he 

said. 

"Ma toll me fuh git twenty-fibe cent" wut ah flour 
'long dish'yuh one," she fibbed. 

"I'll give you twenty cents' worth," he countered, 
and, as she nodded in acquiescence, jubilant at the 
thought of having outwitted him, he plunged his scoop 
into a barrel and weighed out twelve cents' worth of 
flour. When this had been wrapped and delivered, the 
clerk, knowing by her expectant look that further com- 
mercial transactions were imminent, stood at attention, 
while the girl abstracted the first of the three 
"fo'punce" chickens from her apron and held the noisy 
fledgling, naked and unashamed, at arm's length above 
the counter. "Ma tell me fuh git dis seb'npunce 
chickin wut uh side meat," she ventured, craftily 
watching the face of the Caucasian whom she sought 
to overreach. 

"Why, that's a fo'punce chicken. He ain't half the 
size of the other one." 

"Yaas'suh, alltwo come out de same nes' en' alltwo 
hatch out de same time. Da' todduh one duh dish'yuh 
one bubbuh, en' dish'yuh one duh da' todduh one 
tittie. Him look big mo'nuh dish'yuh one 'cause him 
duh roostuh en' him hab comb, en' dish'yuh one duh 
pullet en' him ent hab no comb, en' de roostuh greedy 
mo'nuh de pullet, en' him nyam de mor'is' bittle, en' 
dat mek 'e stan' so," she prevaricated unblushingly. 
These earnest asseverations had no effect on the pur- 
chaser, however, and, appraising the gallinaceous juve- 
niles at ten cents each, he stood pat, and one by one 
they were withdrawn from the apron and exchanged 
for bacon, sugar and molasses. Upon the pouring oi 
the latter commodity, however, Aryan and African 
again locked horns. The weather was warm, and as 
even the thick "blackstrap" molasses flowed freely, the 
careless shopman very nearly gave his customer the 
full quart for which she had paid — an inadvertence 
which, it should be said in justice to his commercial 
acumen, he very seldom committed. Realizing too late 
that nearly all the molasses had run into the tin bucket 
out of the quart measure (false-bottomed as it was) 
he gave it a quick upward flirt to save what he could, 
and started back to the barrel, but was checked by the 
girl's scream of protest. "Ma tell' me fuh tell you 
'sponsubble fuh mek you fuh po'rum out 'tell eb'ry 
drop done dreen een de bucket," she cried excitedly, 
and, in shame-faced compliance, he let her hold the 
measure till the uttermost drop had been "dreened" 
out. With a sideswipe of a very questionable finger, 
she garnered the dulcet drops that clung to the curved 
lip of the cup and, sucking the sweetened digit greedi- 
ly, she grinned with satisfaction. And now, with the 
packages carefully tied up in the bandanna in one 
hand, and the covered tin bucket in the other, she 
dropped a curtsy, for she was a polite little darkey, 
and went her ways homeward, sweetened in soul and 
saliva. 

The night was dark, and the path traversed a small 
bay, where the sweetgums spread their limbs above the 
track, and their heavy foliage hid the stars and deep- 
ened the shadows along the way. Along the edge of 
the bay, in the sodden soil, grew lush water-grasses, 
and they were very sweet to a vagabond ox, as he 
cropped them, undisturbed by flies, in the cool night 
air. But the peaceful ox, playing truant, poor wretch, 
from his negro master, was full of tragedy, for the ox 
was white, and no solitary negro in the low-country, 
where the forests are full of little negro graveyards, 
can bear the sight of anything white in the woods at 
night. The fear of ghosts is always with them, and 
a white cow, grazing in or near a graveyard, will often 
stampede a road full of worshipers returning from a 
prayer-meeting. 

As she reached the shadowy places along the way, 
the child heard a rustling sound in the bushes that 
suggested snakes. She instinctively jumped to the 
other side of the path, at the same time looking over 
her shoulder in the direction of the sound. One glance 
was enough! The pallid ox loomed gigantic in her 
affrighted eyes, and, with a scream of terror, she fled 
homeward and was soon, wide-eyed and trembling, 
before her mother. Faithful to her trust, she had held 
on to bundle and tin bucket, but the molasses was spat- 
tered liberally over her bare legs and had soaked her 
homespun skirt and apron. 

"Wuh 'smattuh, gal? You done t'row'way half de 
muhlassis! Wuh de debble mek you duh trimble '." 

"Ma, w'en uh binnuh walk t'ru de branch, een da'

"Tell yo' bubbuh fuh git da' hom'ny spoon en' 'crape

en' tek off yo' ap'un, en' you en' yo' bubbuh alltwo kin

At the close of the war, thousands of disbanded 
negro troops, how many, only the Lord knows and the 
pension roll shows, swarmed over the Coast Counties 
comprising the South Carolina Black Belt. Swagger 
in their new-minted freedom, and resplendent in the 
light blue trousers and dark blue coats of the Federal 
uniform, with ridiculous little forage caps perched 
aslant upon the sides of their kinky heads, like 
chickens roosting on leaning poles, girdled with great 
brass-buckled U. S. Belts, and shouldering army mus- 
kets, full of insolence and of ribaldry, they took the 
highways and the by-ways for their own. Their for- 
mer masters, however kindly they had been to them 
before and since freedom, were frequently spoken of 
behind their backs as "de rebel," and the days of 
slavery were referred to as "rebel time"' (times). Some 
of these soldiers had served for years, perhaps, others 
for months or weeks, few of them had smelt powder, 
all of them had smelt and fattened upon the bad — 
wickedly bad — bacon with which the loyal sutlers had 
supplied the invading army. (And, by the way, thous- 
ands of tierces of that same sutler's bacon of the years 
'64 and '65 were still at large for full five years there- 
after, supplied by the Charleston and Savannah fac- 
tors to the low-country planters for their plantation 
commissaries.) 

In addition to the disbanded troops, thousands of 
other negroes, who had never seen service, wore cheaply 
bought Federal uniforms and long, light blue overcoats, 
and sported caps and belts and condemned muskets, 
so that the whole countryside was black and blue, and 
they were constantly drilling, while the women, pea- 
hens that they were, worked for them and admired 
the strutting of their lordly peacocks. Often at night, 
from the quarters of a distant plantation, instead of 
the peaceful "tap, tap-a-tap, tap-a-tap, tap-a-tap," of 
the sticks which the negroes beat on the floor to mark 
time for their dancing and "shouting," there would 
come the rattle of a snaredrum, and one knew that an 
awkward squad was being put through awkward evo- 
lutions in the compound or "nigguhhouse yaa'd" for 
the edification of the quarters. 

It was a psychological study to watch one of these 
squads or companies drilling or parading on the public 
highway, when a white man of a former slave-holding 
family approached. Neither stern disciplinary eye, 
nor sharp command, could keep the lines straight until 
after "de buckruh" had passed. There were sure to be 
some members of the squad whose hereditary respect — 
stronger far than the fear of the drill master — would 
impel them to scrape a foot or pull wool, till the align- 
ment was as wabbly as a swimming moccasin. 

One August day in the early '70s, Prince Manigo, 
captain of the Adams Run Company, ordered his com- 
mand out for drill, inspection and maneuvers. Sixty- 
five men reported; these were of all ages from 17 to 
70. Some of them belonged around the village, but 
most of them came from about Toogoodoo, "down on 
de Salt," as the inland negroes designate the sea coast 
and the contiguous lands lying along the salt rivers 
and creeks. 

The place of assembly indicated by Captain Manigo 
was about a mile south of the village on the way t<> 
Toogoodoo. Once a member of Col Thomas Went- 
worth Higginson's negro regiment, the "First South 
Carolina Volunteers," organized at Beaufort in 1862, 
he had known picket duty about Port Koyal Ferry 
during the war, and wished to familiarize his dusky 
outfit with service in the field. The road ran along 
the edge of a deep swamp, or bay. The growth on the 
rich lowlands was heavy, and beautiful magnolias, 
close-limbed and tall, as is their habit of growth in 
thick places, rose to a height of sometimes a hundred 
feet, the sunlight flashing from the curved backs of 
their dark and glossy leaves. Under these great trees, 
sweet bay, red bay, beech and maple grew in a tangle, 
and below these, tall canes and great sword ferns, with 
riotous vines of bamboo and wild grape, thickened into 
an almost impenetrable chaparral. In these woods, 
dimmed to a twilight darkness, Captain Manigo 
established his picket posts. Fifteen or twenty men 
were selected for this dangerous duty, for, at this 
season, the swamp was full of rattlesnakes and some of 
those picked for outpost duty objected. "Man, I cyan' 
go een da' t'icket. Snake dey dey fcumnmch." 

"Snake cyan' see fuh bite now," said another. "Ent 
you know suh rattlesnake' hab skin 'puntop 'e yeye een 
Augus'munt'? 'E bline'. 'E cyan' see fuh bite." 

"Uh dunkyuh ef 'e viz bline', ef uh 'tep 'puntop'um 
'e gwine bite me." 

"Go 'way, man, snake ent gwine bite you w'en you 
hab muskick een you han' wid dat shaa'p bay'net en 
t'ing 'puntop'um." 

So all objections were overruled, and the posts estab- 
lished at intervals of a few hundred yards, the pass- 
word "raccoon" was given to the corporals, and the 
captain and his inspectors, dismissing the remaining 
members of the company for a rest period, prepared 
to test the line of outposts. Making a wide detour they 

sneaked through the woods almost noiselessly. The 
dead leaves, fallen during the preceding winter, had 
softened long ago and were rapidly settling into the 
thick mold that covered the damp earth. Sneaking up 
on the farthest sentinel from the rear, Prince was 
almost upon him before the startled negro challenged 
"Halt! Weh oonuh gwine? Gimme de passwu'd!" 

"Kaecoon," Prince responded. 

"Oonuh cyan' go t'ru 'puntop dat wu'd." 

Prince expostulated. "Raccoon" was the password 
he had given the corporals to pass on to their men. and 
having been selected as a word of singular appeal to 
the negroes, should have been one of the easiest to 
remember, so he repeated petulantly "Raccoon, rac- 
coon, raccoon.' 1 '' 

" 7T yent ivut" insisted the sentinel, as the long 
bayonet projected threateningly through the gum 
bushes. "Dat passwu'd cyan' specify. Da' longmout'

As the corporal was several hundred yards away. 
Prince retired grumbling, and attempted the line at 
another point. He approached a wary old picket, a 
noted 'coon hunter, whose experienced ear detected 
even the soft footfalls of the inspectors, and he hailed 
them at a distance of 50 yards, in most unmilitary 
language. "Haw, buck! Oonuh try full sneak 'puntop 
me, enty? Uh binnuh hunt rokkoon en' dem todduh 
waa'ment en' t'ing 'fo' you bawn! Come out. bubbuh ! 
Ill yeddy you' foot en' uh see bush duh shake alltwo. 


Come out de t'icket. Exwance en' gimme de passwu'd !" 
But they couldn't give it ; not at least intelligibly to 
the ear of old Caesar. Prince spoke with only a slight 
taint of Gullah, and when he had given "raccoon" to 
his Toogoodoo corporals, who understood him only 
after several repetitions, he didn't realize that they 
would pass it on as "rokkoon" and that as "rokkoon" 
the "open sesame" of the countersign must be given. 
Again, therefore, with his own password correctly pro- 
nounced, the Captain had reached an impasse, and as 
Caesar truculently stuck out both his mouth and his 
bayonet, the Corporal of the guard was demanded. 

"Cawprul uh de gyaa'd ! Pos' number t'ree!" he 
bellowed. "Mekace en' come'yuh ! T'ree mans dey 
yuh duh try fuh git t'ru bedout no passwu'd. Ef dem

The thick-lipped corporal came. 
"'Smattuh, Unk' Caesar? Yuh fuh call me?" 
"Yaas, uh fuh call you fuh true. Mek dese'yuh man 
fuh gi' we de sign." 

"Raccoon!" bellowed Prince. 

"You shum, entv ! Entv uh tell vou e vent hab'um !" 
"Yaas, man, da' duh him! 'Rokkoon' duh de pass-

"Uh dunkyuh how dem eegnunt Nyankee call rok-

"RokkoonP conceded the chapfallen captain, and he 
passed, somewhat chagrined at the outcome of his 
picketing experiment. 

The outposts were recalled, the other negroes aroused 
from among the roadside bushes where they had been 
resting, and the full company assembled for drill. The 
outfit was heavily officered, and the captain allowed 
them to take turns at putting the men through their 
paces. At last they were turned over to Mingo Brown, 
a pompous corporal, so puffed up with "a little brief 
authority" that most of the negroes grinned in his face, 
and some openly guffawed, "eh, eh, Bull Mingo 
swonguh fuh sowl!" The men, a ragged line, were 
ranged on one side of the road, and, facing them on 
the other, Mingo drew a great cavalry sabre and 
began to cut such anthropoidal antics before high 
heaven, that three gentlemen, returning from a suc- 
cessful hunt, reined in their horses a few yards away 
and paused to see the fun. 

" Tenshun ! Tan'up traight, oonuh man ! Oonuh

the command would have taken them over hunters and 
pack, they had reversed the order and started in the 
opposite direction. 

"Fuh true, bubbuh, enty you see Mas' Eafe en' Mas'

"Buckruh, de debble ! Enty de Freedmun Bruro mek

Some were shouldered, others ordered, a few "pre- 
sented" with the butt of the piece against the waist 
and the bayonet sticking out at right angles to the 
body. " 'Tenshun ! Da' man f 'urn Slann" Hun' wuh duh 
'tan 'up close da' 'tump fuh hoi' 'e gun een alltwo 'e

Groun', aam/" And the whole perspiring line squatted 
and laid their pieces on the ground, rising just as the 
hunters gathered up their reins and rode along the 
line, while the hounds, with lofty tails, trotted after 
them, sniffing scornfully at the warriors' legs as they 
passed. 

"Huddy, Mas' Rafe. How ole Missis en' dem?" 
"Mas' Tom, you look nyung mo'nuh Mas' 1 Rafe." 
"Yaas, suh. Phyllis him well, suh, tengk Gawd." 
"Mas' Dick, you sho' hab uh hebby buck," as the 
great velveted horns of a fine buck tied behind the hun- 
ter's saddle brushed against him. And all down the 
line, their hands being free, men touched their little 
monkey caps or tugged at their kinky forelocks and 
scraped their feet, in token of the kindly respect in 
which, spite of freedom and franchise, muskets and 
uniforms, and the poisonous propaganda of the Freed- 
man's Bureau, they yet held those known throughout  

the countryside as having been kindly masters to their 
slaves, and just and liberal employers of the freedmen. 

"Mas* Rafe, please suh, gimme some tubackuh," and 
the outstretched hand received a generous share of the 
contents of the donor's pouch. 

u Da' dull my maussuh," said the recipient proudly, 
filling his pipe as the hunters rode away. 

"Cump'ny fawm two t'ickness' een de rank," shouted 
Mingo savagely. u I)on' > look at de buekruh, look at yo'

"Yaas, bubbuh. Buzzut free en' buzzut black, but

A few years after the war old John Harrison came 
into the coast country from somewhere beyond Caw 
Caw Swamp. He boasted a strain of Indian blood, 
and he showed it in his pigeon-toed walk and the red, 
coppery tint that stained his bronzed face. Six feet 
tall and powerfully built, he carried his fifty-odd 
years lightly, although his high, heavy shoulders were 
somewhat hunched from the heavy burdens to which 
they were accustomed for, a noted "pot hunter," he 
thought nothing of "packing" a hundred and fifty- 
pound buck five or ten miles through the forest. Dur- 
ing the close season for game he was not averse to 
working, and had quite a local reputation as a shingle- 
maker and rail-splitter. His speech was the ordinary 
"cracker" dialect of the low-country with a suggestion 
of the Gullah, but he clipped his words, and when 
excited, his sentences ran into a quick crescendo, almost 
unintelligible and defying reproduction in print. 

When he came to Pon Pon he was allowed to clear 
a small field in a distant part of the plantation, a mile 
away from the "big house," now only a beautiful ruin, 
with ivy, woodbine, and Lamarque roses clambering 
50 feet in the air over the 200-year-old chimneys of 
English brick. On his "new ground," old Harrison 
built a large and trim-looking log cabin, and here he 
took up residence with his motherless children, two 
small girls and a straight and strapping son of 18, 
who helped his father with his work, but not in the 
chase, for Harrison hunted alone, sometimes, with a 
single well-trained hound, disappearing for two or 
three days at a time, to return laden with venison or 
wild turkeys which were sold at the railway station. 
 

His dog:, like those of most of the "pot hunters" who 
follow the chase on foot, was trained to silence, and 
never gave tongue. A small bell was attached to his 
collar and he was seldom out of sight of his master, 
who could tell by the movement of his ears and tail 
when the animal had found a trail, and when the lift- 
ing of the ears and the more rapid wagging of the 
tail indicated the near approach to the myrtle thicket 
where the deer lay in his bed, both barrels of the muz- 
zle-loader were cocked and Harrison usually got a shot 
as the deer "jumped." 

Ben Summers, a large black negro in late middle- 
age, was a "locus" preacher in the neighborhood and, 
a jackleg carpenter, worked as well as preached. 
Throughout his life he had been partial to wives, hav- 
ing been more or less affiliated with six or seven, whom 
he put away and took back again, with no more cere- 
mony than his change of mind. Unruly and insub- 
ordinate as a slave, he became "sw 7 onguh" with free- 
dom, and was more or less insolent, save to his former 
master's family. He was regarded as a rascal by 
whites and blacks, and when a calf or a shoat was 
missed in the community, Ben was not infrequently 
suspected of having shared the meat, either as a par- 
ticipant in the slaughter, or as a welcomed guest at 
the banqueting board of the thief. 

One of Ben's wives had achieved a son bv a former 
husband, before Ben took her over, and this stepson 
had acquired a wife, a husky, corn fed wench, an Ama- 
zon in strength and fierceness. Soon after her mar- 
riage, old Ben, a rough-talking, brutal fellow, who 
tyrannized over the women of his entourage, under- 
took to discipline this step-daughter-in-law with phy- 
sical chastisement. Cutting a hickory, he proceeded to 
manhandle her as he had been accustomed to use his 
wives. She accepted two or three blows, and then 
turned upon him so swiftly that he was swept off his 
feet and mauled almost into unconsciousness. After he 
had been patched up and rehabilitated, and the first 
bitterness of defeat had worn off, he really liked to 
tell the story, laying the unction to his soul that only 
his Christian spirit had stayed his hand and saved the 
life of the virago. 

"Ben, you are a big strong man, why did you let 
that woman beat you?" 

"Gin'ul, lemme tell you de trute, Gawd bin wid me 
dat day. You know, all me life uh bin uh strong man. 
Uh nebbuh hab no man fuh outdo me fuh wu'k, eeduh-

Once a fine shoat strayed too near to Ben's little field 
and soon found its way into the old man's larder, where 
it was found by a search party in charge of old Harri- 
son. An examination showed that the animal had been 
shot with duck shot, and shot of the same size having 
been found in the undischarged barrel of the negro's 
double-barrel, Ben was arrested and sent to Walter- 
boro jail and Harrison was summoned as a witness. 
Harrison was fond of a dram and looked forward to 
the approach of court week which would bring him a 
visit to the county seat with witness fees of 50 cents a 
day and mileage. Walterboro was 35 miles away, and 
five cents a mile both ways meant $3.50, which loomed 
large in the mind of the old hunter. On the Saturday 
night before the convening of court, he prepared a 
week's rations of cornbread, bacon and baked sweet 
potatoes, and early Sunday morning filled a great 
knapsack, and, with his long gun on his shoulder, 
walked all the way to the county scat. On the follow- 
ing day the pig thief was duly arraigned, the jury 
organized, and old Harrison, loaded to the muzzle with 
Walterboro whiskey, to which he had been treated by 
the youngsters who liked to hear him talk, came to the 
witness stand, a '20-pound knapsack of provisions 
around his shoulders and his long gun in his hand. 
His direct testimony was: 

"Sunday mornin' bin over t' Cap'n Elliott's, coz 
mostly Sunday mornin' ef uh goes by th' house Cap'n 
gennully gives me uh pow'ful drink, en' uh alius likes 
me dram. Wen uh got through me dram, uh was 
walkin' 'long by ol' Ben's house, en' uh heerd uh gun 
shoot. Uh meet some boys and went to th' house en' 
fin' th' shoat en' fin' number two duck shot een 'im. 
Uh fin' ol' Ben's gun in the corner, one barrel been 
fired, en' uh drawed th' load of t'other barrel en' fin' 
number two duck shot, same size ez een th' shoat. Then 
uh told Cap'n, he give me 'nother dram, we 'rested ol' 
Ben in th' pulpit where he was preachin' to a raft uh 
niggers, en' we send him to Walterboro." 

Then came the cross-examination. The young law- 
yer for the defense baited old Harrison to the great 
amusement of the court room. 

"What do you know about duck shot?" he was asked. 
"I don't believe you know the size of a duck shot." 

"Uh don't know de size uv uh duck shot ! Course 
uh knows de size uv uh duck shot. Bin hunt'n' all me 
life, bin shoot'n' duck shot all me life." 

"If you know the size of a duck shot, take this pencil 
and let the jury see you draw one on the court house 
Avail." 

Harrison rose with bleary eyes and a fatuous smile 
on his bronzed face. Unable to read or write, he held 
the pencil as a small boy holds a sizzling firecracker, 
but he was game and stepped up to the wall primed 
with the confidence born of ignorance. Judge, jury 
and spectators craned their necks to see the perform- 
ance. The draftsman stuck close to the wall and 
moved the pencil slowly and laboriously over the 
whitewashed surface. When at last he stepped back 
and turned around proudly to reveal his work, the 
court house exploded with laughter, from Judge Wal- 
lace on the bench, to the tipstaff at the door, for the 
tipsy old hunter's outline of a duck shot was about 
eight inches long and five inches wide and bore a 
st liking resemblance to the continent of Africa. He 
returned to the witness chair. Taking the shouts of 
merriment as tributes to the accuracy of his sketch, he 
looked scornfully at the young lawyer. 

"Ain't I tell ye uh know'd d'size uv uh duck shot? 
Bin shootV duck shot all me life. Course uh knows 
d'size uv uh duck shot !" And there was more laughter. 

The negro was convicted, and sent to the peniten- 
tiary for two years, but was soon leased to a railroad 
contractor, and, becoming a "trusty" and a cook, had 
an easy time. When he returned to Pon Pon he 
resumed his place in the pulpit without the slightest 
loss of caste, and often referred to his sojourn in the 
Capital City, telling many stories to the members of 
his Hock about "de time w'en uh bin penitenshus," or 
"wen uh bin Cuhlumbia." 

One Christmas morning old Harrison came to the 
house with the portentous information that he intended 
to marry the widow Pendarvis. was then on his way 
to her habitation seven or eight miles away, and would 
bring back his bride the same evening. 

"Dat whut uh vaim t'do Cap'n. Uh knows hit- 
pow'ful resky t'marry uh widder. coz dey alius knows 
toomuch, but uh needs uh 'ooman to clean up en' do 
about d 'house, en' look after d'children, en' de widder 
Pendarvis is uh right peart creeter, en' she ain't got 
uh lazy bone een her, so uh reck'n uh'll resk it. Den, 
she's got a son, John Henry, 'bout d'age uh my 
William. John Henry he ain't much account, but uh 
needs anuther han' en' uh reck'n uh kin make out wid 
John Henry, so uh yaims to tek d'widder." 

The old adventurer was fitted out with a white shirt 
and a handkerchief, a pocketful of Christmas candies 
and a couple of stiff snifters, and so, fortified, he 
started toward the widow, stepping high, gun on 
shoulder. "Uh alius totes m'gun. Y'never knows whut 
y'gwine t'see." 

So the widow Pendarvis was duly acquired and 
proved a faithful and useful spouse, but old Harrison 
soon reached the conclusion that he had been gold- 
bricked in John Henry. "He ain't no manner uv 
account. Ain't wuth d'powder'n shot it ud'take t'kill- 
'im ! Wen uh married d'widder, uh didn' aim t'git 
much uv uh bargin in John Henry, he was jus' kinder 
throw'd een fuh good measure like, but now uh wisht 
he mout uh bin throw'd out." 

A year or two later William Harrison was walking 
the woods one day, and from a shallow grave at the 
edge of a negro's field, his dogs dug up the hide and 
head of a stolen cow which the thief had buried to 
hide the ear-marks and the brand. The negro was 
sent to jail to await trial and William was subpoenaed 
as the chief witness. Old Harrison protested. " 'Taint 
uh bit uh use t'sen' William t'Walterboro fuh fifty 
cents uh day, w'en 'e's makin' seventy-five cents uh 
day now. W'y don't yuh take my stepson John Henry  

Pendarvis fer uh witness? He ain't a workin' en' he'll 
be glad t'git d'fifty cents uh day." It was explained 

to the old hunter that as John Henry had not found 
the telltale hide and head, and knew nothing about l In- 
case, he could not be accepted as proxy. ''Don't make 
uh bit uh diff'unce. William kin tell John Henry 
whut he found en' John Henry kin go t'Walterboro en' 
swear to it. John Henry he's a noble liar, en' he kin lie 
en' stick to't. Them Walterboro lawyers can't shake 
him." 

After awhile, bad health came upon the former 
widow, and in taking palliatives to relieve her pain, 
she became addicted to opium and spent all she could 
scrape for the drug at the village store. At last the 
neighborhood doctor warned her husband, '""Harrison, 
if you don't look out, some day your wife will take an 
overdose of laudanum and go up the spout.' 1 

"Well, Doctor, 'tain't f uh me to go ag'in her ! She's 
bin'uh noble 'ooman in 'er time. She's never had uh 
lazy bone een 'er body. She's bin uh pow'ful hand to 
do about, en' she's bin as peart uh 'ooman as ever was 
wropped up in that much hide, but she's gitt'n kinder 
poorly now, she ain't whut she used to be, she ain't 
much account now, she can't scrub no mo', she's got 
de rheumatism in de jints, so. Doctor, if she aims to 
go, uh reck'n d'best thing to do is to let her take a 
pow'ful dost en' let 'er goT So — poor, tired soul— she 
went. 

Twenty- five years ago, old Jane was the very efficient 
cook at the Pawley's Island hotel. A widow woman 
of fifty-odd, her black countenance, with its aquiline 
nose and sharp chin, was shrewd and witchlike. 

"Old maids" are seldom met with among the low- 
country negroes, most of the women achieving matri- 
mony, or having matrimony thrust upon them, at an 
early age in communities where marrying and unmar- 
rying are but the merest incidents in their social and 
economic lives — and they are largely socio-economic 
relations, — "Uh haffuh hab wife fuh cook fuh me en' 
wash me clo'es, enty?" "Uh haffuh hab man fuh wu'k 
fuh me en' min' me, enty?" — "and so they were mar- 
ried." 

Often, however, in early life, less frequently in mid- 
dle age, women are, for the moment, unmarried, or, as 
one might more correctly say, unaffiliated, and if one 
of these "unaffiliations" should last long enough to 
constitute more than a very brief intermission in the 
matrimonial program, one, if of the fiercer sex, incurs 
the odium supposedly attaching to "oldmaidenhood." 

Jane had in her time looked upon husbands in yellow 
and brown and black, and had almost run the chro- 
matic scale in temperament as in pigmentation. The 
sharps had irritated, the flats had wearied her — the 
"naturals," being neither too sharp nor too flat, were, 
like the small wee bear's belongings, "just right," and 
Jane, like Chaucer's Wife of Bath, thanked the Lord 
for them while they lasted. "But pleasures are like pop- 
pies spread," and, as in Georgetown colored circles hus- 



hands don't always "stay put," one by one Jane's pop- 
pies — perhaps she thought them snap-dragons — folded 
their petals and their tents, and, forsaking the dusky 
companionship of the old love, flitted away to present 
freedom and prospective enslavement to the new — for 
there's always a new — u ef rokkoon only hab one tree 
fuh climb, dog ketch'nm," being an axiom among them. 
As .lane couldn't trot in double harness, she single- 
footed successfully for several years — so successfully, 
indeed, that she developed a fine scorn for the opposite 
sex. "Dem ent wut," she thought, and u dem ent wut" 
she said, whenever men were mentioned. In her soli- 
tude she found solace in industry, and, working at odd 
jobs during the winter, supplemented her summer 
earnings at the hotel and soon acquired enough to buy 
"uh piece uh groun' " (the coast negroes never speak of 
land) and built thereon a comfortable cabin, near 
which, within a wattled clapboard fence, she enclosed 
a plot where she grew the easy-going squashes and 
beans in summer, and Georgia col lards — the holly- 
hocks of the vegetable garden — in winter. 

Jane's domain was on the mainland in the flat pine 
woods thick sown with clumps of the dark green tropi- 
cal-looking saw-palmettoes, and bordered the marsh- 
fringed inlet or tidal lagoon, beyond which, half a 
mile distant, lay the broad ocean beach, the rolling 
sand dunes and the dwarf live-oak and cedar scrub of 
"the Island." Here, nestling among the thickets, and 
sheltered under the protecting shoulders of the hills. 
were the summer cottages of the Islanders, and here, 
too, just opposite Jane's cottage, stood the hotel, where 
all through the summer days she fried whiting, boiled 
sheepshead, deviled crabs, and did sundry other things 


to the sea-food that the fishermen constantly brought 
to her kitchen. Jane's riparian rights permitted her a 
landing where, moored to a primitive little pier, she 
kept the flat-bottomed skiff in which morning and 
evening she crossed the imvexed waters that lay 
between her home and her work. 

Esau, a trifling, ramshackle, youngish negro, made 
an easy living by fishing, crabbing and doing odd jobs 
about the Island community. He was venturesome, as 
most saltwater negroes are, and often in the early 
mornings ran his leaky skiff through the breakers at 
the mouth of the inlet, and rowing — or wafted, when 
the wind favored, by a rag of a sail — adventured out 
to sea five miles from the beach, dropped an anchor 
made of two condemned iron pots tied together, and 
fished upon the blackfish rocks in the broiling sun till 
noon, returning to shore to sell the good fish to the 
Islanders and, later, eat the culls and odds and ends 
himself. On other days, when the East wind warned 
him that the fish wouldn't bite, he bogged about the 
little creeks and runs of the marsh, or along the edge 
of the lagoon, and caught crabs by the basketful, 
which usually found a ready market. 

Bringing his fish often to the hotel, Esau was on 
pleasant conversational terms with old Jane, and she 
often handed him out toothsome bits of "buckruh bit- 
tie" that fell from the overflowing table. In return for 
these gastronomic courtesies, Esau would chop wood, 
split kindling, or do other manly things that chival- 
rous colored bucks not infrequently perform for the 
females outside of their own family circles. 

One hot August morning, Esau gathered lines and 
bait as soon as it was broad daylight, and, slipping over 

the shallow bar at the mouth of the lagoon, sculled 
lazily out to the "drop"'' on the rocks. It was a wind- 
less dawn, the sea was without a ripple, and the slow, 
heaving swells reflected the opalescent tints of the east- 
ern sky. The tide was still on the ebb, and its impulse, 
augmenting his speed, soon brought him to the drop 
where he cast anchor, and the boat swung round, bow 
to land, while Esau, in the stern, sat with his back to 
the rising sun and threw out his lines. The fish bit 
well, and at the end of two or three hours the bottom 
of Esau's boat was well covered with the shining catch, 
chiefly speckled sea trout, whiting and blackfish. The 
sun increased in warmth, and Esau nodded and dozed 
and then slept, although, with the turn of the tide, the 
prow of his boat now pointed seaward and the sun- 
shine burned in his face. At last, at noon, when its 
beams fell vertically upon his kinky head, he awoke 
with a start as a big horse-mackerel leaped from the 
water so near him that he was drenched with its spray. 
He looked out upon a sea of molten silver. A great 
shark, as long as his boat, rose slowly from the depths 
to within a foot of the surface, and, lying motionless, 
regarded him with cold, expressionless eyes. Esau 
shuddered. "Great Gawd" he muttered, "time fuh 
gone home!" and, as the sinister creature sank out of 
sight, he quickly hauled up anchor, shipped oars, and 
pulled lustily to shore. It was high tide when he 
reached the inlet, and he rode the long rollers over the 
bar, and soon ran the nose of his skiff ashore on the 
oyster shells of the landing. He strung his fish and 
set out to find a market, but the time lost while he 
slept had made him too late to supply the dinners of 
his usual customers, and, as his fish were now stale, he

had no recourse but to eat them himself, so he set about 
cleaning them, and an hour later, when Jane, having 
served the hotel dinner, was dining alone in the 
kitchen, Esau appeared and ingratiatingly asked the 
loan of a frying pan, "please, ma'am, en' some greese 
fuh greese "urn." As neither fat nor fuel cost Jane 
anything, she graciously complied, in the handsome 
spirit that prompts so many of us to be generous at 
the expense of others. Esau rubbed the greasy bacon- 
rind over the broad, generous bottom of the hotel fry- 
ing pan and, having lubricated it sufficiently, cast in 
his fish, and the horrible sound and the horrible smell 
of frying soon filled the ears and the nostrils of every 
one about the establishment. Esau fried and he fried 
until, having filled a large tray with fish, he hung up 
the frying pan. took down his appetite, and began to 
eat. Esau was an eater, and had no half-dealings with 
his art. Seizing a fish by the head and tail, he moved 
it laterally across his mouth as some traveling men 
maneuver green corn on the cob, or as the village dar- 
key plays the mouth-organ, until, in the twinkling of 
an eye, only the bones remained in his greasy fingers; 
then he played another mouth-organ, until in a few 
minutes he was filled to the neck, and only ten or 
twelve fried trout remained, and these he cached with 
old Jane for future attention, and betook himself to 
the shade of a scrubby live-oak nearby to rest. He 
threw himself on the sand and slept for several hours 
like a gorged Anaconda. At last, toward sundown. 
the land breeze brought the mosquitoes from the main- 
land across the lagoon, and they swarmed over him. 
Thrashing about in his troubled sleep, some of the 
cockspurs that grow everywhere in the Island sands

worked their way through his thin homespun trousers 
and stung him into wakefulness. He arose grouchy 
and grumbling, and returned to the kitchen where 
Jane was already preparing supper. "Eh, eh, weh 
you bin, Esau?"" she greeted him. 

"Uh binnuh sleep, ma'am, en' muskittuh" en' cock- 
spuhr' en' t'ing wake me en' mek me fuh git up." 

"Wuh you gwine do wid dese fish wuh you lef", 
Esau? De buckruh sen' wu'd suh dem fish duh bod- 
duhr'um, en 1 'e tell me fuh t'row'um een de ribbuh." 

"Uh had bidness fuh eat all dem fish one time, den 
uh wouldn' haffuh t'row'um 'way." And Esau sidled 
over to the tray of fish, and, looking at them regret- 
fully, pinched off nibbling bits with his fingers and 
carried them to his mouth. 

"You bettuh t'row'way da' t'ing, Esau," admonished 
Jane as she bustled about her work. 

"Yaas, ma'am, uh gwine t'row'um 'way bumbye. Uh 
vent duh eat'um, uh jis' duh pinch'um." And he went 
slowly out toward the lagoon with the tray under his 
arm, but, as he walked, he pinched the fish so assid- 
uously that, by the time he came to the water, little 
save the bones remained. 

Two hours later, Jane approached the mistress of the 
house with an anxious face. "Please, ma'am, fuh

"Wuh da' las' one you call 'e name, Missis?" 

"Whiskey."

A liberal dose of mixed ginger and peppermint was 
poured into a tin cup, the rim of which Jane forced

between Esau's teeth, and drenched him so successfully 
that in a few minutes he was flopping over the ground 
like a fish just pulled out of the water. His spasms 
were soon over, however, and he lay in a state of semi- 
coma. Jane was delighted. "Missis, me en' you done 
sabe Esau' life. Da' nigguh blonx to me en' you, Missis, 
en' uh gwine mek'um wu'k." 

Summer passed into early autumn. The days short- 
ened. September suns burned fiercely upon the ripen- 
ing corn, and through the lengthening nights heavy 
dews fell on the purple petticoat-grass and the golden- 
rod. Between sunset and dusk, summer ducks flew 
over from their feeding grounds to their roosts in the 
pineland ponds, and all through the night sounded the 
faint "tweet, tweet" of the ricebirds passing on to 
their winter quarters. 

So Jane, in the late summer of her days, looked 
kindly upon the man she had saved, even though she 
did not value the salvage very highly, and Esau grad- 
ually got in the habit of hanging about her kitchen 
and submitting to the air of proprietorship which she 
assumed toward him, chopping wood and doing other 
little chores for her, as a matter of course. 

At last, one Thursday evening toward the end of 
the month, Jane bashfully appeared before her mis- 
tress, holding a corner of her apron against a corner 
of her mouth, which widened almost from ear to car. 

"Missis, uh come fuh tell you, ma'am, uh gwine 
marri'd Esau. Da' nigguh dull heng roun' de kitchen 
'tell 'e git een me way. Uh cyan'' tu'n roun' bidout 
step 'puntop'um, so uh gwine tek'um fuh husbun'." 

The announcement caused quite a flutter among the 
ladies at the hotel, and. as Jane had fixed the following 

181 



THE BLACK BORDER 

Saturday evening for the wedding, they hastened to 
overhaul their wardrobes for suitable material with 
which to deck out the bride. An old dotted-swiss mus- 
lin, found hidden away, was contributed by its owner 
as something sweet and virginal with which to rig out 
the craft that had sailed the seven seas of matrimony. 
Another guest of the hotel contributed a pair of white 
stockings, and, as Jane desired a veil, a breadth of old 
mosquito-netting, stiffly starched and skilfully laun- 
dered, was added to the outfit. On Saturday night, 
an hour after supper time, Jane, under the convoy 
of Esau and accompanied by the "locus pastuh" (the 
local preacher of her church) appeared before the 
hotel company assembled on the piazza, and announced 
her readiness to wed. The mosquito-net veil had been 
artistically looped about her by some of the ladies, and 
the dotted-swiss enveloped her with its starched stiff- 
ness. The knot was soon tied, and Jane, carrying the 
bride cake in her arms and followed by her new hus- 
band, floated away like a smutty coal-carrying brig, 
under a new suit of sails. 

On the following morning, Jane appeared in the 
kitchen earlier than usual. The lady of the house 
asked what she had done with her new husband. "Uh 
run'um off, missis. Uh yent want'um. Wuh me fuh 
do wid man ! Enty uh hab proputty ! Uh marri'd 
Esau fuh git husbun', uh yent marry'um fuh git man ! 
Nigguh' wuh grow up sence freedum, dem ent wut ! 
Uh marry'um, den uh t'row'um 'way!" 

"Why did vou marry him, then, if you didn't want 
him?" 

"Ki ! Missis ! Uh marry'um fuh shet dem todduh

THE PLAT-EYE 

/ All low-country negroes believe more or less in 
"sperrits," "haants" and other mysterious appearances, 
but the "plat-eye," peculiar to the Georgetown coast, 
is the weirdest and most fearsome that vexes the 
roaming negroes at night. Plat-eyes appear to old and 
young of both sexes, sometimes in the form of a small 
dog or other animal, while at other times they may 
float like wraiths along the marshes or unfrequented 
paths, or stoop like low-hung clouds and envelop the 
victim. Most frequently, however, the plat-eye ap- 
pears in the form of some familiar animal which, glar- 
ing at the beholder with eyes of fire, springs upon 
him, frightening him into rigidity, and, just as he 
expects his vitals to be torn out, the apparition van- 
ishes, and the trembling negro hurries on his way. The 
belief has been expressed that, in some instances, the 
negroes to whom plat-eyes appear have fallen asleep as 
they walked, and, dreaming of these terrors, awakened 
to find them gone. In whatsoever form they come, 
however, the negroes dread the visitations as Were- 
wolves were feared in Europe not so long ago. 

Now, old Jane, the cook at the Pawley's Island sum- 
mer hotel, the many-times widowed woman who, hav- 
ing saved the life of Esau, the fisherman, by drench- 
ing him with horse liniment after he had partaken 
too freely of the spoils of his lines, had wedded that 
same Esau to save herself the reproach of old-maiden- 
hood, and had chased him away the morning after 
her Marriage tie Convenanrc, was a fervent and fear- 
ful believer in plat-eyes. Whenever and wherever she 

183 



TEE BLACK BORDER 

went her ways at night, she was on the lookout for 
them, and the expectation of their momentary appear- 
ance kept her nerves in a pleasant state of jumpiness. 
A stray calf at the edge of the clearing, a raccoon 
ambling along a woodland path, a sudden rabbit 
bouncing up before her, the horned owl that lifted her 
wayward fowls from their runaway roost on the ridge- 
pole of her cabin, even the ghostly sandcrabs that 
drifted along the beaches at night as lightly as wind- 
blown foam, were all potential plat-eyes ! 

Two weeks had passed since Jane, the self-made 
celibate, had ejected the transitory husband of her 
bosom from the "bed and board" to which, under col- 
ored custom, if not under State law, he was supposed 
to be entitled. Esau wandered about, following his 
usual vagrant occupations, but vaguely conscious of 
his rather indefinite status as a husband — responsi- 
bilities there were none. Jane, to whom the marriage 
had brought wifehood — in the abstract, and very real 
things in the dotted-swiss and the white stockings of 
her bridal outfit — being withal as free and untram- 
meled in her property and her person as she had been 
before the episode, felt herself the gainer, and, to do 
her justice, regarded Esau rather as a slaughtered 
innocent. In respect of one small matter, however, 
Esau, too, had gained something. During his tenta- 
tive courtship, or rather while, without his knowledge, 
Jane had had him under consideration, he chopped 
wood and did other chores for her without specific con- 
tract for compensation, for Jane was then an unrelated 
and unconnected female of the species, and he will- 
ingly performed these gallantries for her; but once 
married, even though she had so speedily and uncere- 

184 



THE PLAT -EYE 

moniously divorced, or put him away, she was yet his 
woman — in thought at least, his chattel — and, harking 
back to his African ancestry, he bethought him that 
women were but hewers of wood and drawers of water, 
the domestic slaves of the lordly males, and, before 
laving hand to axe or stooping to pick up chips or 
driftwood, he never failed to bargain and chaffer with 
the cook for what she should pay him — at the expense 
of the lady of the house. 

"Esau, uh wish you please kin pick up some chip" 
fuh me full staa't me fiah." 

"Wuh you gwi" gimme?" 

"Wuffuh me haffuh pay you fuh chop wood, Esau '." 

"Enty uh done marri'd you fuh wife? Wuffuh man 
haffuh chop wood full 'e own wife?" 

"Uh marri'd you, fuh true, Esau, but enty uh done 
run you off, en' now you stan' same lukkuh all dem 
todduh man wuh uh nebbuh bin hab fuh husbun'?" 

Esau scratched his head, the point being rather fine 
for his comprehension, but he grunted stubbornly, 
nevertheless. 

"Man hab wife fuh cook 'e bittle fuhr'um, enty? 
Ilukkuh ooman kin cook bittle bidout 'e chop wood. 
eeduhso pick up chip' fuh mek fiah? No, ma'am! 
Wuh you gwine gimme fuh eat ef uh chop wood fuh 
you?" Therefore, whenever Esau chopped wood, the 
hotel kitchen paid the fee. 

September burned and passed away. October came. 
Among the brown and purple trunks of the pines, the 
red-bronze foliage of blackgum and sourwood glowed 
like dull fires. Tripods rose above the breakers, and. 
from the vantage of their elevated tops, the Islanders 
fished with rod and reel for the beautiful channel bass 

IN.-, 



THE BLACK BORDER 

which came up with the rising tide. The long rollers 
crashed upon the strand and broke into lace-like spray 
that the sea-wind tossed into a thousand miniature 
rainbows. The plaintive cry of the sea-birds, the 
whisper of the wild-oats as their ripening seed pan- 
icles rustled in the wind, and the sharp tang in the 
air, brought to the spirit the poignant sadness of 
autumn — "Falling Leaf and Fading Tree," and Tosti's 
haunting melody. 

On a certain night, Jane permitted Esau's escort to 
a cottage two miles up the beach, whither she had 
undertaken an errand for her employer. The night 
was dark and overcast, and the air was heavy with a 
promise of coming rain. A fitful breeze picked up the 
loose sand above highwater mark into little whorls, 
sent them dancing about the upper beach, and set the 
clumps of wild-oats on the dunes above to shivering 
weirdly. The tide was at the flood, and the long dun 
rollers boomed sullenly on the beach and sucked at the 
sands as though loath to leave them. 

As she got farther away from the comforting lights 
of the hotel and adventured into the creepy darkness 
that lay before her, Jane shuddered, and lifted the 
shawl from her shoulders over her bandanna-topped 
head as though to shut out from her apprehensive 
ears all fearsome sounds. Esau shuffled along beside 
her, but he, too, was uncomfortable, for he was a timid 
negro, and even the boldest are none too brave at 
night. 

A sudden gust of wind lifted the foam cap from a 
breaking wave, blew it in their faces and whistled 
eerily through the wild-oats. A ghost crab sprang up 
at their very feet and scurried away, affrighted. Jane 

186 



THE PL AT -EYE 

clutched Esau's arm. "Great Gawd/" she groaned, 
"duh plat-eye ! Uh shum ! uh shum!" 

"Weh-weh 'e dey?" stammered her frightened but 
less imaginative escort. 

Before she could point to the flying crab, another 
pallid, spider-like creature drifted across her path and 
followed the first. Jane was poised for (light, but 
Esau stood firm and steadied her nerves, and in a few 
moments they moved on again, but with wide eyes 
and hesitant steps. At last they had covered half the 
distance, and a mile away, beyond the dark, a spot of 
yellow light marked their goal, which they might have 
leached but for the raccoons' love for shell fish. At a 
low spot in the broad beach the tide had eaten out a 
narrow channel through which the waters rushed 
almost up to the sand-hills, bringing small fish and 
shrimp and clams far beyond the break of the rollers, 
and, at the entrance to this cut, facing the ocean, a big 
raccoon was fishing at the moment the negroes reached 
the tidal rivulet and paused to look for a crossing. 
Esau, with trousers rolled up to his knees, adventured 
first, and as Jane, "standing with reluctant feet," on 
the marge, called to him to ask the depth, she unhap- 
pily cast her eyes seaward just as the four-footed 
fisherman, startled by the voices behind him, wheeled, 
and turned his round, green eyes full upon them, ks 
their sinister light shone fearsomely against the dark 
background of the waves, Jane shrieked in agony. 
"Oh Jedus! de plat-eye! de plat-eye!" And, turning 
tail, she fled along the back track, screaming at every 
jump. Esau's gallantry, and one look at the shining 
eyes, prompted him to follow Jane, which he did at 
top speed, while the wretched raccoon, frightened out 

187 



TEE BLACK BORDER 

of his supper by the havoc he had unwittingly 
wrought, lost no time in attaining sanctuary among 
the scrub beyond the sand-hills. 

On sped Jane. Her screaming-wind gave out after 
the first hundred yards, and, save for her labored 
breathing, she ran silently, Esau, a black shadow, close 
behind. In an incredibly short time, Jane and her 
runner-up reached the hotel, speechless with exhaus- 
tion and fright. When she had recovered her breath, 
Jane hurried to her mistress. "Missis, ma'am, uh neb-

"OLD PICKETT' 

Before the war, the low-country planters, migrat- 
ing each summer to their mountain homes at Flat 
Rock, N. C, frequently bought horses and mules from 
the drovers as they passed along the Buncombe Road 
on their way South from the stock ranges of Kentucky 
and Tennessee. Sometimes beautiful ponies were 
brought from the Pink Beds, away back in the North 
Carolina mountains, others came from the nearer val- 
leys of the French Broad, but most of the Seacoast 
planters supplied their needs from the Tennessee 
drovers as they moved down the main-traveled road. 

From an old drover named Pickett, a mule was 
acquired to which the negroes gave the drover's name. 
Although a young mule, and of the opposite sex, she 
was christened "Old Pickett," and bore the name with 
distinction for nearly a quarter of a century. Long 
and low, and powerfully built, Old Pickett was a light 
bay in color, with the brown stripe down the back 
and the zebra legs which mule wranglers regard as 
evidence of toughness — and Old Pickett was tough. 

Old Pickett came into the hands of the family late 
in October. A thin skin of ice had formed along the 
shores of the lakes. Flocks of blue-winged teal whis- 
tled through the air and splashed as they alighted on 
the clear waters. Chestnuts had fallen, and their green 
and brown burrs covered the ground under the far- 
spreading limbs of the big trees. Their little cousins, 
the chinquapins, had long been gathered and strung 
in necklaces, or roasted at the hearths of the glowing 
wood fires. The pheasant-shooting was nearly over, 

100 



"OLD PICKETT" 

and Westly-Richards and Greener were cleaned and 
oiled and slipped into their buckskin covers, in readi- 
ness for the campaign against deer and duck and tur- 
key in the low-country. With the first days of Novem- 
ber, as the branches of the great oaks cracked under 
the weight of the roosting wild pigeons, and the slop- 
ing sides of old Pinnacle and all the lesser peaks 
burned with the flame-like foliage of the hickory and 
the ruby fires of the oaks, the family started down the 
mountain for Greenville, the first stop in the ten-day 
journey to the sea. Carriages for the ladies and the 
elders, saddle horses for the younger men, and com- 
fortable covered wagons for the house servants, the 
cavalcade moved out, Old Pickett and her companions 
tethered behind the wagons to take their turn at the 
pole later on. 

Arrived at the big plantation, Old Pickett became 
familiar with the plow, the cart and the Gullah negro, 
and for twelve years led an uneventful life, buckling 
to the tough "joint grass" of the uplands in summer, 
and bogging pastern deep in winter as the slim plow- 
share slid through the sticky soil of the ricefields and 
turned the stubble into long greasy-looking furrows. 
While a willing worker, Old Pickett took her time and 
always "gang'd her ain gait." She was nimble, too, 
with her heels, and the stable boys about the mule lot 
could always amuse themselves by throwing sticks or 
light clods of earth on Old Pickett's hindquarters to 
make her "kick up," when she came in to be unhar- 
nessed after her day's work, and she was always ready 
to oblige. Wearing a blind bridle, she could not see 
behind her. but she was strong for the uplift, and 

101 



TEE BLACK BORDER 

whatever touched her in the rear had to go up, whether 
stick, or clod or stable boy! 

Then the war ! In the dawn of an April morning, 
came the sound of the big guns in Charleston harbor 
thirty miles away, and, a few months later, from 
another direction, rolled the thunder of yet heavier 
and more distant guns, bombarding Port Royal, and 
still Old Pickett plowed and carted, and otherwise 
plodded in the ways of peace, but not for long. The 
questing eye of the Confederate Government looked 
approvingly on Old Pickett's short legs, arched loins 
and well-sprung ribs, and, discerning an artillery mule, 
intimated a desire for ownership, but Old Pickett, 
compelling as she did the little negroes who walked 
behind and around her to become alert and watchful, 
was a plantation institution and could not be parted 
with permanently, but she was loaned to the Confed- 
eracy, and for a year or two hauled caissons and can- 
non and army wagons about the coast section wher- 
ever an attack was threatened by the invaders. 

At last, the booming of cannon came nearer, an expe- 
dition having reached Willtown only seven miles away, 
and, as negroes from nearby plantations were "run- 
ning away to the Yankees," a farm was leased in the 
far away land of Abbeville, and thither, for safekeep- 
ing, went a number of slaves under Zedekiah Johnson, 
a kindly and reliable overseer. With this venture went 
Old Pickett, and here, until the end of the war, she 
faithfully followed the curved and crooked furrows 
that ran around the terraced hills, and stubbed her 
unshod hoofs against the flinty stones thick sown about 
the ruddy soil. In the up-country, women sometimes 
plowed, and Old Pickett, blinkered and forward-look- 

192 



"OLD PICKETT' 

ing as she was forced to be, submitted to the indignity 
of being "gee'd" and "haw'd" and chevied along by a 
bare- footed, sun-bonneted female of the species. 

Freedom came. The low-country negroes whom it 
overtook in Abbeville, went their wavs. The wagons 
and mules, all save old Pickett, were sold for the piti- 
ful greenbacks that the profiteering few who had them, 
were willing to pay, and old Pickett came home. A 
low-country freedman, wishing to return to his hab- 
itat, kindly consented to ride her the two hundred 
miles, cannily exchanging his fore-knowledge of the 
road for the use of her four legs. And what a home- 
coming! The "big house" at the head of the wide 
live-oak avenue lay in ruins, sentineled by the tall, 
charred trunks of "Sherman's laurels," the two great 
magnolias that sometime stood in their gloss} 7 green 
liveries overhanging the hospitable hearths that once 
glowed within. Wildcats lurked in the briar thickets 
now upsprung from the fertile soil where once stood 
the great stables. The plantation quarters, whose 
streets formerly resounded with jest and laughter, at 
the touch of the vandal's torch had flared into flame 
and vanished, and among their ashes Jimpson weed 
and other rank growths struggled. 

In a rough stable, hastily improvised of blackgum 
logs, Old Pickett was introduced to strange, young 
Western mules, new to negro ways, but, from the time 
of her home-coming, she seemed to grow resentful 
toward all the world. While still performing her 
tasks faithfully, she would not be hurried, and no 
freedman was ever able to urge her into a trot. so. by 
example, if not by precept, the younger mules asso- 
ciated with her gradually acquired somewhal of trick- 



THE BLACK BORDER 

iness and of truculence. Old Pickett still respected the 
former slave-holding planters, and under one of these 
(she was a good saddle animal) she would still conde- 
scend to canter, but the small white boy of ten or 
eleven years, and the negroes of all ages, she held in 
utter contempt. Saddles and bridles were scarce after 
the war, and spurs were rare. "The Captain" had a 
single ante-bellum spur with which he urged recalci- 
trant horse or mule to such bursts of speed as a grass 
diet would warrant. When rallied by his hunting com- 
panions on his lack of the twin spur, he shrewdly 
observed that if he could make one side of his steed 
travel fast enough to suit him, the other could always 
be induced to go along, too. As this precious tool was 
never loaned, the small boy who aspired to equestrian 
exercise was forced to kick his steed in the ribs with 
his bare heel, to which was sometimes tied, with a 
piece of hickory bark, a forked stick shaped like a 
wishbone, usually an effective goad with which to 
tickle the equine flank, but Old Pickett was unrespon- 
sive. She was, in a manner of speaking, on all-fours 
with St. Paul. "None of these things move me," she 
thought — and they didn't. The ambitious boy who ex- 
pressed a willingness to adventure a trip to the railway 
station, two miles away, for the mail, only for the 
chance to ride, was sometimes offered Old Pickett, just 
to chill his ardor. If he accepted the mount, he was 
given a plow bridle, a folded crocus bag upon which 
to sit, and was allotted a few hours in which to make 
the trip. A stout switch was permitted him, which he 
carried in his right-hand for style, rather than for any 
impression he hoped to make on Old Pickett's tough 
hide. Fortunately, the kindly amenities of war had 

194 



"OLD PICKETT' 

left the great avenue without a gate, or he could not 
have passed, as no amount of urging could have 
brought Old Pickett within arm's length of the latch, 
so the way was clear to the old King's Highway. The 
boy had plenty of time to admire the scenery as Old 
Pickett walked sedately along between the willow- 
fringed canals that flanked the approach to the "Two 
Bridges." In the summer, water snakes dropped 
quietly into their element from the overhanging 
branches upon which they had been sunning them- 
selves, terrapins slid from their floating logs, and now 
and then a small alligator sank slowly downward, 
leaving only his eyes above the water. Just beyond, 
where the boughs of a grove of Spanish oaks stretched 
above the road, squirrels sometimes played, alighting 
among the smaller branches with a soft "swish" as 
they sprang from tree to tree. Then, on to Jupiter 
Hill, or "Town Hill," as the negroes called it, because 
it lay in the direction of Charleston. Here, with a 
clay hole on one side and a Colonial milestone on the 
other — "31 M. to C Town" cut in its brown sandstone 
face — the roads forked, the right-hand leading to the 
Village, the left to the station. Although Old Pickett's 
way always led to the station, she never failed to sub- 
mit the selection of the road to argument, and invaria- 
bly leaned to the right. Whether the memory of the 
brave, hopeful, early days of the Confederacy, when 
she had drawn artillery or army wagons along t In- 
road, urged her to tread again the once familiar paths, 
or whether she sought only to match her will and her 
wits against the boy's, one may not know, but. as far 
as the boy was concerned, the discipline was whole- 
some, for loss of temper availed nothing against Old 

195 



THE BLACK BORDER 

Pickett. Her response to an application of the switch 
was to sidle up to the nearest tree or sapling, against 
which she would rub her rider's bare legs, so she was 
seldom switched. Sometimes the boy would sit on her 
back ten or fifteen minutes without moving, while she 
drowsed and dreamed of the past, and then, when, 
perhaps, she had forgotten the dispute between them, 
he would get her started in the way she should go. At 
other times, however, when she could not be wheedled 
out of the Village road, her rider let her have her waj', 
and, after going two or three hundred yards, would 
slowly turn her head into the pineland and, gradually 
sweeping around in a wide semi-circle to the left, 
would reenter the road to the station a quarter of a 
mile beyond. Arrived at his destination, the boy 
would be fortunate to find some idle negro around 
who would bring out the mail to him, for, once dis- 
mounted, he could not remount without assistance, 
Old Pickett invariably backing her ears, baring her 
teeth, and altogether turning toward him "an unfor- 
giving eye and a damned disinheriting countenance." 
To grown-ups Old Pickett was dangerous only at the 
rear, but to a dismounted boy she was loaded at both 
ends and — a revolver at that — she was so pivoted that 
head and tail could swap places with surprising facili- 
ty. Old Pickett's tracks on her way home, however, 
were the prints of peace. Like so many of the human 
race, she knew the way to the trough, and thither she 
was willing to be guided. 

On Sundays, Old Pickett was turned into the big 
pasture with the other mules, for rest and recreation, 
but, while her companions galloped or trotted and 
played, she kept away from them, grazing alone until 

106 



"OLD PICKETT' 

satisfied, when, withdrawing to a far corner of the 
field, and resting her head upon the rider of the rail 
fence, she would gaze into space with restrospective 
eyes. Sometimes the Sunday outings would be in corn- 
fields after harvest, where the slovenly freedmen 
usually left bunches of rank-growing sheep burrs, 
having a strong affinity for the manes and tails of 
horses and mules. Of these, Old Pickett acquired her 
share. The negro who plowed her extracted without 
difficulty those which lodged in her mane, but the tak- 
ing of them out of her tail was an event in stableyard 
circles. Strongly tethered in her stall with a short 
halter, a stout bar w r as run into grooves behind her, so 
hampering her hindquarters that she could not extend 
herself. Thus helpless, she was ignominiously de- 
spoiled of the burrs that clung to her tail, even the 
small black boys participating in the spoliation, of 
which they did not fail to brag later to their com- 
panions at the quarters. 

"You see dis sheep buhr, enty? Uh tek'um out'uh 
Ole Pickett' tail," said one, proudly pulling a burr 
out of the wool about his ears. 

"'Xo, you nebbuh ! You duh Gawd fuh projick "long 
Old Pickett' tail? 'E yent come out'um!" 

" ? E yiz, now!" 

'"Event!" 

'"Eyiz!" 

" 'E yent!" and then they fought. 

Besides the burrs acquired by her mane and tail. 
Old Pickett sometimes got them in her ears, and then 
a circus act w r as necessary to get the bridle over her 
head in the morning. 

One summer afternoon, crook-legged, yellow Sabey 

107 



THE BLACK BORDER 

came up to the house to borrow a mule with which to 
drag from a distant backwater a large alligator he had 
just killed, offering to recompense the favor by bring- 
ing a portion of the creature's oily flesh to be cooked 
for the always hungry hounds. As all the other farm 
animals were busy, Sabey was told that he might have 
Old Pickett, who grazed alone in a distant pasture. 
Not knowing Old Pickett intimately, the poor darkey 
scraped his foot gratefully, and taking a bridle from 
the rack, an ear of corn from the crib and a bundle of 
fodder from the stack, he set out as gaily and as full 
of faith as the small boy who, receiving from an elder 
his first handful of "fresh salt," goes forth in quest of 
the elusive robin's tail. Arrived at the pasture, Sabey 
shambled toward Old Pickett, holding the ear of corn 
and the blades coaxingly before him. The bridle was 
hidden from sight at his back, tied to a hickory bark 
suspender. As Sabey approached, though he looked 
like no Greek that ever walked, or fought, or ran, Old 
Pickett, appraising the provender as camouflage and 
fearing even the Gullah bearing gifts, raised her head 
and looked at him suspiciously, but, as Sabey slowed 
down his pace and called "coab, coab, coab"' softly and 
appeal ingly, she let him come up to her and conde- 
scended to nibble at the outstretched handful of blades. 
The negro's favorite method of catching a loose mule 
is to seize her firmly by the ear, and to this Old 
Pickett, without an earful of sheep burrs, might have 
submitted, but, as Sabey grabbed, the sharp burrs were 
pressed so painfully into the inner lining of her ear, 
that she wheeled as quick as a flash and, lashing out 
with heels that had lost none of their youthful vigor, 
would have lifted Sabey into the air had he not with 

108 



"OLD PICKETT" 

quick presence of mind thrown himself flat on the 
ground, so that she kicked over him. When the imme- 
diate danger had passed, Sabey rose to his feet and 
followed her about the pasture for two hours, in the 
vain effort to coax her again within reach, or to drive 
her into a fence corner, where he might, by getting a 
rail behind her, so pen her up that the bridle could be 
slipped over her head without danger. But Old 
Pickett could neither be led nor driven, and, just as the 
sun was setting, Sabey returned alone to the house.

Old Pickett had now passed her twenty-fifth year, 

199 



THE BLACK BORDER 

and day by day became sadder and wiser. She accepted 
her daily tasks with resignation, but not with enthus- 
iasm. The sockets above her weary eyes grew deeper, 
and white hairs thickened among the tawny pelage 
about her brow. Her ears, once so erect and responsive 
to all the sounds of the world about her, now flopped 
dejectedly like an unstarched "cracker" sunbonnet. 
Her lips, as pendulous as those of the bull moose that 
once tried to bite the Faunal Naturalist, hung lower 
and lower, and the hour drew near when she must 
shuffle off the mortal harness she had worn so long. 
Her eyes had looked upon smiling Peace, upon grim 
War, and — under Reconstruction, the once proud plan- 
ters on foot and their quondam slaves on horseback — 
it was time to go. Turned out in the pasture to spend 
her last days in idleness, she walked listlessly about, 
cropping here and there a bunch of tender grass, 
while she waited for the summons. When it came, and 
she lay down to rise no more, a black spot, slowly cir- 
cling in the sky, stooped, and, on a lower level, sailed 
again in narrowing circles. The keen eyes of other 
questing vultures, miles away, watched the drop, and 
followed. From the four corners of the heavens they 
came, and, alighting on rail fence and blasted pine, or 
hovering low on shadowy wings, they watched and 
waited, until at last Old Pickett's glazing eyes told 
them that her heart and her heels were stilled forever. 
A month or two later in the Autumn, when the fam- 
ily returned to the plantation from the pineland vil- 
lage, the boy indignantly reproached the negroes for 
not having given Old Pickett decent sepulture, and 
two of them were induced to gather up her whitened 
bones and bury them in a shallow grave at the edge of 

200 






"OLD PICKETT 1 ' 

the ante-bellum "horse burying ground," where the 
old family horses rested under the live-oaks. The 
negroes could not understand the boy's emotion as the 
clods fell on the bones of the faithful old mule. "Eh, 
eh, buckruh boy too commikil. Him duh cry 'cause 
mule dead! 1 " They did not know that the passing of 
Old Pickett severed a link with the golden past, and 
that into her grave went something of The Lost Cause ! 



201 



THE LOST BUCK 

An hour after sunrise, hunters and pack assembled 
at the appointed rendezvous, a centrally situated plan- 
tation. There was the usual exchange of pleasant bad- 
inage as to the relative speed, stamina and other quali- 
ties of the different hounds, who, now united in an 
imposing pack of twenty, combined almost every type 
known to the deer hunter, and each had its admirers. 
The older men preferred the native low-country stock, 
a blend, perhaps, of the blood of fox hound and beagle, 
bred for a hundred years or more from dogs brought 
from England long, long ago. These were fine, high- 
bred looking animals, mostly "blue speckled," flecked 
with patches of black and fawn, whose twisted ears, 
soft as velvet, were long enough to tie under their 
wearers' throats — very aristocrats of the dog world, 
from their long muzzles to the tips of their slender 
"rat" tails, not very fast, perhaps, but with noses so 
"cold" that they could follow a deer trail more than 
twenty-four hours old. Then, too, their cry! "Roll- 
ing tongues," all of them, sweet and sonorous, whose 
blending of deep and high-pitched tones sent the blood 
tingling through the veins. The hard-riding young- 
sters, however, preferred the recently imported "Eng- 
lish" dogs — thick-set, powerful creatures, white, with 
great patches of black and tan, broad-eared and 
"feather-tailed." Their noses were not cold, nor was 
the music of their yelping "chopped" tongues inspir- 
ing, but they had great speed, and their feet were so 
hard that they could be run day after day without 
becoming footsore. Here and there, a somber spot in 

202 



THE LOST BUCK 

the pack, was a black and tan and— a touch of flame— 
a big "red-bone" of a western North Carolina strain, a 
rangy fellow, bred to speed and endurance in a rough, 
red-fox country. So each type and each individual 
had special qualities and special advocates, and all 
were gathered— Countess, Echo, Music, Harper, Lead, 
Luck, Modoc, Rowser, Blueman, the panther-like 
Huntress, and many younger dogs— into a pack whose 
all-round efficiency could not have been matched 
between Ashley River and the tawny waters of the 
Savannah ! 

At last the horns were sounded, and horsemen and 
hounds passed up the Cypress road. Soon after cross- 
ing the two bridges a mile or so away, a short consul- 
tation was had, and the "Elliott Big Drive" was 
decided upon. The elder huntsmen directed the 
standers to their positions and, after allowing sufficient 
time for those who had been assigned the more distant 
passes to reach their stands, the two expert and daring 
riders who had been designated as the "drivers" put 
in the eager pack and they spread fanlike among the 

myrtles. 

The old buck, whose trophies were the special object 
of this day's hunt, had long baffled the Nimrods of the 
neighborhood. Unusually large and with a magnifi- 
cent head of "basket" horns, his resourcefulness had 
always enabled him to escape his pursuers. He varied 
his tactics as occasion required. In the early fall and 
winter, while lying with does and yearlings in the 
myrtles, or on the sunny side of some broomgrass field, 
he would cunningly keep his place upon the approach 
of hounds and hunters, allowing his companions to 
spring up and lead the cry off on a long run for the 
river. Then, when the danger was over, he would 

•jii:: 



THE BLACK BORDER 

sneak away and take sanctuary in some distant thicket. 
Later on, in February and March, when the bucks, 
having dropped their horns, herded together like 
timid sheep, he pursued the same course, allowing the 
younger and less experienced to "jump" at the 
approach of the pack and lead it away while he 
remained in safety. In his bachelor days, however, he 
changed his methods, and, at the first cry of a distant 
dog opening upon the trail, the wary buck would 
"sneak," and, by the time the pack reached his erst- 
while bed, they found only the outline of his burly 
body in the petticoat grass where he had made his 
luxurious couch, while the old fellow would be per- 
haps six or seven miles away in the Ti Ti across the 
Edisto, or in some remote and inaccessible fastness 
beyond the Toogoodoo. In summer, when his great 
antlers in the "velvet" were tender and sensitive to the 
slightest touch of twig or foliage, he avoided thickets 
and tangled places, skirting the ridges that rose like 
shoulders on either side of the narrow bays that inter- 
sected the great forests of long-leaf pine. 

But on this crisp November day, the woods were 
clean and clear, with no tangle of summer foliage, and 
the big buck, now carrying iron-hard horns, was as 
free to run through swamp or thicket as on the higher 
knolls and ridges, and, cunning and deceitful, he 
changed his tactics from chase to chase, and kept his 
pursuers guessing as to whether he would "jump" or 
"sneak," whether his course would be east, ' south or 
west. Northward he never ran, for thither lay the 
railway and the flat woods, with no rivers beyond 
whose waters lay sanctuary. 

One of the standers, well-mounted, took up a dis- 
tant pass at Elliott's Wells, the site of a settlement 

204 






THE LOST BUCK 

abandoned many generations ago. Concealing his 
horse in a thicket at the rear of the stand, he returned 
to the knoll, stood in front of a great pine, a giant 
among its lofty fellows, and listened for the cry of the 
pack. But listening was difficult and no cry came to 
his ears. The wind was high, and, singing among the 
pine tops like seolian harps, rose and swelled and 
softened and died away, now whispering of the wold 
with its peaceful sheep, and quiet meadows where 
cattle grazed, now thundering of stormswept moun- 
tain tops and the break of ocean surges on rockbound 
coasts, and again softened to the lap of sluggish wave- 
lets on the shining shores of placid bays, and sighing 
told of those that grieved, and shrieked with the 
anguish of those that suffered, and softened again with 
the laughter of little children, and told the myriad 
stories and waked the thousand memories that the 
weird and mysterious songs of the wind among the 
pines bring to those whose hearts are attuned to nature. 
More than once the stander stood at attention, think- 
ing he heard the cry of a distant hound, but, with a 
lull in the wind, the aural will-o'-the-wisp was gone, 
so misleading are the wind-sounds to even the trained 
ear. An hour passed. Two hours — but only the wind 
was heard, no bay of dog, no blast of horn betraying 
the presence of hunter or hound anywhere in the great 
expanse of forest. 

Not far aw r ay was an old graveyard, one of tin' 
Colonial villages of the dead occasionally found in the 
low-country forests. The lettering on the marble slabs 
that covered the eternal sleepers revealed them as 
members of important families, many of them chil- 
dren who died of fever during the summer months 
before the days of quinine, deep wells and wire screens. 

20.j 



THE BLACK BORDER 

The stander, while listening for the cry of the pack, 
read the lichen-covered inscriptions on the tombs and 
mused like Gray and Omar. With a whimsical smile, 
he looked at the towering crown of a great water-oak 
deep-rooted in the mould of a stout-hearted 17th cen- 
tury squire — a "five-bottle man" perhaps, and mar- 
veled at the alchemy of nature that could, from 
Madeira, Port and old Jamaica Rum, resolve a dew to 
nourish a Water Oak! Then, with ineffable sadness, 
he read the brief life-stories of God's little children, 
"Mary," "Anne," "William," "beloved daughter," 

"beloved son" "of and his wife," "died 

August 171 — ," "died September 17*2 — ." A cherub 
deep-carved in the marble, the line "Suffer little 
children to come unto Me" — no more ! Seven, eight 
generations of men and women had lived their lives 
and passed since these little children were taken home 
200 years ago ! Yet, how near the tragedy seemed ! 
The father returning from field or forest to find the 
mother in agony over the stricken child, no doctor, no 
ice, no effective medicines. The brilliant eyes, the 
burning cheeks, delirium, the end. The little mound 
in the woodland, wet with a mother's tears, the 
graver's chisel in the marble — and that was all. So 
men and women lived, and little children died — two 
hundred years ago ! 

At the end of the fourth hour of waiting, the 
stander, hearing only the wind-harps among the pine- 
tops, and realizing that, either the pack had jumped 
and been led by the chase out of the drive — a cunning 
old buck sometimes running contrary to all prece- 
dent — or that, striking no trail, the drivers had 
"blown out" of the Big Drive and called the hunt 
together for exploitation elsewhere, mounted his 

200 



THE LOST BUCK 

horse and rode due west through the woods for the 
Willtown road, which, running north and south, and 
nearly parallel with the Edisto and its tributary 
Penny Creek, would be crossed by any deer making 
for the river. Just as he reached the road, he accosted 
a negro walking toward Parker's Ferry X-Roads, and 
asked if he had heard horns or hounds.

Sure enough, the veteran Echo, the most intelligent 
dog in the pack, was running wide when she reached 
the road for the second time and detected the old 
buck's maneuver. With a roar, the pack followed her 
at top speed down the open road, but, by the time the 
cry reached the Allston place on Penny Creek, the 
buck, with two or three miles the start of them, had 
run directly through the negro quarters, causing gen- 
eral consternation in the settlement, and had taken the 
water at the landing. Instead of crossing, however, he 
swam rapidly up stream and, aided by the flood tide, 
was a mile away before the pursuing pack reached the 
water's edge. True to their usual practice, they crossed 
the creek and spread over the swamp on the other side 
in search of the trail, but trail there was none. The 
puzzled hounds ran up and down the bank for several 
hundred yards, whimpering with disappointment, but, 
for them that day, the buck was lost as completely as 

208 



THE LOST BUCK 

though the brown waters had swallowed him up, and 
one by one the disappointed dogs reluctantly recrossed 
the stream, and, as there was no sound of horn to sum- 
mon them, singly and in groups they made their wax- 
to their respective homes. 

Realizing that the buck had run far out of the chive, 
and, by giving all the passes a wide berth had lost the 
hunt, the sometime stander of Elliott's Wells followed 
the spreading slot of the deer in the "big road" as far 
as Allston's, and, riding up to the quarters, sought 
information of hounds and quarry from an old negress 
who was seated on the steps of her cabin, trying t<» 
loosen, with a tough horn comb, the kinky wool of a 
little black girl who sat on a lower step between her 
knees. 
"Mauma, have you seen anything of a deer or dogs?" 
The old woman, true to her training, tried to rise to 
drop a curtsy before replying, but the wide-eyed imp 
of darkness between her knees sat stolidly on the hem 
of her homespun skirt and prevented her rising. 

"Git up, gal, ent you hab sense 'nuf fuh mek y<>' 
mannus w'en you see w'ite people? Uh bin agguhnize 
'long all dem fowl' fedduh en' t'ing you hab een you

en' you hab no bidness fuh gone en' creep t'ru da' fowl- 
h'us' winduh fuh git dem aig'. Git up en' gone!'' 

But long before she reached the end of her sentence, 
the girl was up and gone, and, with a deep curtsy, the 
old woman answered the hunter. 

"Maussuh, 'bout two hour attuh middleday, dish'yuh

Meanwhile, the big buck's sensitive ears told him 
what had happened. He knew that the pack, at fault 
and silent, a mile behind him, was out of the running 
for that day, at least as far as he was concerned, and, 
touching bottom on a little wampee-covered spit of 
land that thrust itself into the creek, his dun and drip- 
ping body rose from the waters as he leisurely walked 
to shore, landing conveniently near a dense canebrake, 
within whose safe seclusion he found a dry bed until

nightfall. With the rising of the moon soon there- 
after, he slowly fed his way homeward through the 
forest, pausing, first near the edge of the Baring hack- 
water, and then on every knoll where he could find ;i 
grove of the beautiful swamp white-oaks, for his favo- 
rite autumn food, the great over-cup acorns. At last, 
as the morning star blazed in the east and the far 
off roosters — long before Maude Adams won her spurs 
and her tail-feathers in Edmond Rostand's Chan- 
ticler — heralded the coming of the dawn, the old fel- 
low returned to his bed among the myrtles in the Big 
Drive, and, full of acorns and the satisfaction of hav- 
ing again outwitted his pursuers, lay down to his 
well-earned rest, undisturbed by dreams of horn or 
hound.

JIM MOULTRIE'S DIVORCE 

The tail of a cold, blustering February day. In the 
creeks and leads of the Jehossee marshes the ducks 
sought protection from the wind until flushed by the 
hunter. Since early morning he had successfully 
explored every promising hiding place in the great 
marsh, under the guidance of Jim Moultrie, a skilled 
negro hunter and paddler, who pushed the nose of his 
clumsy dugout canoe up every little run that looked 
like a likely shelter for the wary game. As the sun 
sank below the horizon, staining the sky a dull red, 
the hunter quitted the marshes, and the bow of the 
canoe was turned toward Willtown, five miles away. 
Crouching low in the stern, Jim paddled silently and 
strenuously against the current for an hour. Like 
birdshot "patterns" thrown against the red sky, flocks 
of belated blackbirds hurried to their roosts. 

Gradually the shadowy mantle of the dusk shrouded 
marsh and headland and the shimmering waters that 
slid by the struggling canoe; then night fell and healed 
the blood-red wound in the West. The dugout crept 
along the shore where the current was less swift. Xow 
and then a raccoon hunting in the marsh sprang away 
affrighted. The whistling wings of a swift-flying teal 
cut through the icy air. Far up the river, like low- 
hung stars, twinkled the watchfires of a great timber 
raft outward bound for the estuary of the Xorth 
Edisto. From a distant plantation came the sweet 
lu-la-lu of a happy negro freed from work. The raft, 
borne upon the bosom of the strong ebb-tide, neared 
rapidly, and, around its fires built on earth-covered 

212 



JIM MOULTRIE'S DIVORCE 

platforms, the negro raftsmen talked and laughed as 
they cooked their supper, and the flames lighted the 
face and magnified the figure of the black steersman 
who stood by the great sweep oar with which, at the 
stern of the raft, he guided its course down stream. 

For an hour Jim had silently bucked the tide, 
impelling the boat under the powerful strokes of his 
paddle, alternately left and right. 
"What are you thinking of, Jim?" 
"Study 'bout 'ooman, suh." (A short silence.) 
" 'Ooman shishuh cuntrady t'ing, dem nebbuh know

LISS "BIN EENSULT" 

From Olar, that favored spot in a fruitful section 
of the State, where, under the guidance of a Carolina 
Burbank, the amorous Iron pea, loving the "Shinny" 
despite her freckles, wooed and won her to wilt -resist- 
ance, where quiet farmers are classical scholars and 
hermits are hospitable, comes a story of Liss, a charac- 
ter as noted in local colored circles for oddity as for 
ugliness. A white neighbor, who recently met her, 
noticing that she was swelling with wrath, and. seeking 
to get a rise out of her, asked: 

"What's the fun today, Liss?"

THE RETORT COURTEOUS 

Her name was Patty. She was as black as a tar 
baby, as oleaginous as a cotton oil mill and — like Cap- 
tain Merrimac in Olivette — as broad in the beam and 
as square in the rig as a Dutch brig, when she appeared 
before a tidewater trial justice as the prosecuting wit- 
ness in re the State of South Carolina vs. Cudjo Man- 
igo, charged with malicious mischief. 

Taking the stand, she put her head on one side and 
complacently smiled until the corners of her mouth — 
evidently designed for the wholesale trade — approached 
dangerously near her ears. Twisting his amber 
imperial, his Honor began : 

Q. "What's your full name?" 

A. "Mis' Wineglass, suh." 

Q. ''Where's your residence?"

Q. "Yes. What's your charge?"

THE CAT WAS CRAZY 

On a recent Sunday afternoon, an itinerant evange- 
list with a throat of brass was stationed at the corner 
of Richardson and Plain Streets in Columbia, singing 
hymns in the laudable endeavor to save a soul or two. 

From an upper window of the Grand Central Hotel 
a fair face looked out to the westward, while a child 
tapped upon the pane. 

At a club window opposite, a young bachelor banker 
sipped his Sunday cocktail while he eyed critically 
the passers-by on their way from church. How many 
of their financial secrets did he hold in his keeping! 
How many of their obligations were locked in his 
vaults! The note of that jauntily dressed young man. 
who held his head so high as he spurned the dust from 
his patent leathers, had gone to protest but yesterday. 
The extravagance of yonder portly lady, who, with 
silken sails spread to the breeze, towed after her, as a 
tug tows a coal barge, one of the fashionable fourteen- 
inch trains, scattering in her wake banana peel, cigar 
I nuts and other miscellaneous wreckage of the street, 
had cost her husband another mortgage. 

The banker was of a thrifty mind, and he wondered 
why, in the name of Saint Peter — why. in the name of 
the patron saints of cleanliness and all the gods of 
common-sense, fashion should exact of its devotees the 
performance of the nnaesthetic work of the street 
sweeper and the scavenger! Thinking, with a sigh, 
that shorter skirts might have permitted longer bank 
accounts, he turned his eyes to the wooded hills of 
Lexington above which hung the setting sun. a great 

225

disk of gold. With his mental coupon shears, the 
speculative financier, quickly clipped the "orb of day" 
into gold treasury certificates, put them out at in- 
terest — compounded, of course — and, with one more 
Vermouth cocktail to aid his imaginative computation, 
he was, in a twinkling, possessed of the wealth of 
Monte Cristo. And now the world and all beyond was 
his! On fancy's wings he sailed away, away to 
Arcadie. Instead of herding bulls and bears, a shep- 
herd now was he. Like Strephon, he played upon a 
pipe, while at his feet the lambkins played, or hud- 
dled together in the sunshine "so warm and sleepy and 
white." 

Garlanded with roses, the shepherdess led him 
through leafy bowers into an open glade, where, among 
the buttercups and daisies, he fell asleep, and dreamed. 
Ay, Dios! How few of us realize, until all too late, 
that the simplest pleasures are the best, that in home 
and friends we may make for ourselves happiness far 
above that which must be sought beyond our circle. 
How few of us realize that there is more exhilaration 
in a five-mile spin than in a quart of champagne, that 
'tis more blessed to swish the briefest cotton skirt in 
Arcadie — if in Arcadie we belong — than to drag a 
satin train in a Paris salon ! 

But the banker dreamed, and the strains of the 
Santiago waltz were in his ears, and the houris of 
Mahomet glided along before him wreathed in — smiles. 
One, fairer than the rest, beckoned, and he followed 
on and on. Out into the darkness he followed the 
golden gleam of her beautiful bi-carbonated hair, fol- 
lowed through tangled forest and treacherous fen — 
alas ! the will-o'-the-wisp ! 

With a start, he awoke from his reverie to find — like 

226 



THE CAT WAS CRAZY 

the market girl who stumbled and smashed the basket 
of eggs from which she had hatched out all her hopes — 
that his gold was gone, for suddenly the sharp edge 
of the horizon was drawn like a scimiter across the 
throat of the sinking sun, and in an instant the western 
sky, away up to the zenith, was stained as with his 
life blood ! 

With a shudder, as though chilled from sitting in 
the overdraft of his imagination, the banker took his 
hat and went out into the street, where the evangelist, 
having closed his song service, was exhorting the little 
group clustered around him. 

Suddenly, on the edge of the gathering, an old 
negro, bent with age and with a face furrowed by 
grief, appeared. He led by the hand a little black girl 
about ten years old. Her eyes were round with fright, 
and about her thin legs a ragged red calico skirt 
flapped like a weather-stained flag at half-mast. 

The old man skirted the group, eagerly scanning 
each face as though looking for a sympathetic ear into 
which to pour his sorrows. Not finding what he 
wanted, he hurried on toward the State House, drag- 
ging the child after him, until, in front of a news- 
paper office, he saw a round-waisted gentleman with a 
priestly look talking to a tall, long-bearded one of the 
old school. Detecting benevolence in the faces of both, 
he approached the shorter of the two. and, in an 
anxious voice, inquired — "Maussuh, please, suh, tell me 
ef cat kin git crazy?'' 

"Do you mean is it possible for a cat to have rabies?" 

"No, suh, 'taint rabbit, 'tis cat." 

"I apprehend," said the English purist, "that you 
desire to ascertain whether it is possible for a cat 1«>

have the rabies. I may say, for your information, that 
there are, literally and mathematically speaking, 18 
phases of insanity to which humanity is subject, rang- 
ing from the emotional insanity of commerce, to the 
popular mania a potu, vulgarly called delirium ine- 
briosa. I do not care to give an off-hand opinion as 
to whether or not a cat may have one or more of these 
kinds of insanity, unless you will accurately describe 
the symptoms and put your questions categorically. It 
is manifestly a work of supererogation — " 

"Great Gawd, maussuh!" said the old man, turning 
appealingly to the tall gentleman. "Please, suh, tell

A CONGAREE WATER-COLOR 

During 1 the last freshet in the Congaree river, three 
negroes living on the Childs plantation five miles be- 
low Columbia took advantage of the high water to go 
rabbit hunting in a boat. Paddling about between 
the tree trunks, they scanned the knolls and tussocks 
that, rising above the flood, afforded sanctuary to the 
cotton-tail refugees. 

So intent were they upon the chase, that the care- 
lessly managed skiff struck a cypress "knee" and was 
instantly swamped. Fortunately, the trees were thick, 
and the wrecked crew climbed into a tall gum, where, 
far above the swelling flood, they spent the entire 
day, sending out from time to time across the waste 
of waters a piteous cry for help, until, late in the 
evening, their voices were heard from the highlands, 
and a boat was sent to their rescue by Mr. Childs. 

Mingo Singletary, one of the treed nimrods, was in 
the city yesterday, and gave the following account of 
the adventure: 

"Yaas, suh, me en' Silus Smit' en Hacklus Rab'nel,

WAITING TILL THE BRIDEGROOMS COME 

On a hot June day a year or two ago, a tall, pump- 
kin-colored negro was leisurely plowing an unambi- 
tious mule in a cornfield in Lower Carolina. Min- 
zacter Singleton was his euphonious name, and he 
was about 55 years of age. 

As he passed up and down the furrows he whistled 
cheerily, for the brown earth that curled away in 
long waves from his plowshare was mellow and rich, 
and the bourgeoning corn that bristled around him. a 
grand industrial army, uniformed in blue green, 
epauletted with crimson silk and plumed with cream 
white tassels, was full of promise for the autumn. 
Here and there a convolvolus vine that had escaped 
the last hoeing twined lovingly around a sturdy stalk 
and. clambering boldly up, swung its purple, white- 
throated cups among the feathery blooms of the corn, 
where the swift-winged honey bee and the yellow- 
barred bumblebee plied their busy trade. 

These sights, however, affected not Minzacter. He 
was a materialist, not a poet; and, mindful of his one- 
third interest in the crop that he was "laying by," 
he concerned himself far more with the occasional 
bumping of his singletree against the corn stalks, 
than with the soft music of the wind harps that crept 
from among the broad blades as the breeze passed 
through them. 

High up in the blue, a crow flew slowly over the 
field, twisting his head from side to side, while he 
critically inspected the work in progress; and. find- 

233 



THE BLACK BORDER 

ing that it was good, croaked out an occasional 
"ckwarrow, ckwarrow." 

As the friar of the middle ages— the prototype of 
this black-robed fellow — unctuously took from the 
fields of his flock a tithe of the garnered store, so, 
when the blades should be stripped away and Septem- 
ber suns harden the grain, would this "sukkus 
preechuh" claim the reward of his interest in, and 
inspection of, the growing crop. As the ominous 
shadow passed between him and the sim, Minzacter, 
looking up, said : "N'mine, bredduh ! Tek care buzzut 
don' dance at yo' fun'rul dis same berry fall! You 
smaa't 'nuf fuh know w'en man got gun een 'e han', but 
yo' eddycashun cyan' specify w'en 'e come fuh tell w'en 
shell' cawn got pizen een um. You fly high een de 
ellyment teday, tek care you don' flew low befo' Chris- 
nms come!" 

Upon reaching the end of his row, Minzacter found 
awaiting him the burly black constable of a neighbor- 
ing Trial Justice, accompanied by a middle-aged 
brown woman, who, as the plowman came to a halt, 
accosted him with: "Mistuh Singleton, I t'awt you 
was a juntlemun, but I come to fin' out you cyan' 
specify as a juntlemun, 'cause you run'way en' lef 
me obuh to Goose Oik, en' gone en' marry Paul 
Jenkin' grumnia jes' 'cause 'e got fo' cow en' I ent got 
no cow. You run'way en' lef yo' lawfully lady, en' 
I come to tek you to de Trial Jestuss fuh t'row you 
een Walterburruh jail." 

With apparent nonchalance, Minzacter said: "Go 
'way, gal ! Who you call husbun' ? I nebbuh see you 
sence I bawn. I gots no time fuh hoi* cumposhashun 
wid eb'ry w'ich en' w'y 'ooman dat come 'long de 
road. Dis cawn gots to lay by." 

234 



WAITING TILL TILE BRIDEGROOMS COME 

Julia Singleton, the ecru claimant, left him with 
the threat that she would go home and fetch the 
marriage "stiihstiffilrit" to prove that Minzacter wa- 
ller lawful husband. 

Sure enough, on the day set for the preliminary 
examination, she appeared with not only the marriage 
certificate, but accompanied by her brother and the 
Rev. Sancho Middleton, the Goose Creek "locus pas- 
tuh," who was alleged to haA'e performed the cere- 
mony. 

Upon being arraigned for bigamy, Minzacter denied 
indignantly any knowledge of the woman. The "'stuh- 
stimkit'' was put in evidence, but as it read simply, 
"I marry Mistuh Singleton to Missis Singleton," the 
Trial Justice ruled that it couldn't "specify." The 
claimant's brother and the preacher had been tam- 
pered with by an agent of Minzaeter's and, at the 
last moment, they went back on the prosecuting wit- 
ness. The brother was put up first, and Julia did the 
questioning. 

"Bredduh," said she, "ent you 'membuh dat een 
June munt' een de same year w'en us cut down dat 
new groun' 'cross Caw Caw Swamp, en' de same time 
w'en Sistuh Frayjuh him had two twin, ent you

'"I vent know nutt'n' 'bout'um,'' said the traitor. 
"nebbuh shum sence I bawn, ent know 'e name, need-

"Mistuh Jestuss," said Julia, ruefully, "I come to

"Well, suh, ent you "membuh wen you renite me to

A GULLAH'S TALE OF WOE 

From the clay chimney of a negro cabin in the 
lower part of Hampton County the blue smoke curled 
and floated away in graceful rings. Within, the 
flames crackled cheerily in the generous fireplace, and 
a woman, surrounded by half a dozen children, was 
preparing the evening meal. The building was of 
logs, with moss and clay plastered into the crevices, 
and the roof which covered it was of clapboards. An 
humble dwelling it was, but big enough and warm 
enough to shelter old Scipio Wineglass and his family, 
and it represented — together with the few acres of 
land surrounding it — the net earnings of twenty-seven 
years of toil "sence freedum fus' come een." 

The crop had been gathered and locked in the little 
corn crib that nestled up under the eaves of the cabin, 
and among the shucks that lay around the door a few 
pigs were rooting. As the twilight fell on this crisp 
December evening, the querulous bark of a squirrel 
came from the swamp, and away down the road the 
sound of a horse's hoofs in a sharp canter became 
louder and louder, until, at last, a horseman rode up 
and asked for a drink of water, just as old Scipio came 
in from the woods with a log on his head and threw 
it down with a grunt. 

Bringing a gourd of water out to the gate, he eyed 
the stranger closely as he drank, and as he took back 
the dipper he asked, "Maussuh, enty puhlicituh kin 
oughtuh able fuh read?" 

"Certainly, solicitors are able to read. Why do you 
ask?"

THE DOCTOR DIDNT "EXCEED" 

Down upon the banks of the turbid Toogoodoo — one 
of the many creeks that indent the seacoast of Colle- 
ton County — lives June Middleton, a negro of the old 
school. As a body servant, he followed his master 
through Virginia "eenjurin' uh de wah," and. at its 
close, he received for his faithful service a few acres of 
the plantation upon which he had been reared. His 
little holding was as dear to him as was ever an 
entailed estate to an English noble, for, like all 
Southern negroes who had formerly belonged to fami- 
lies of culture and refinement, he shared the pride of 
his quondam owners in their ancestral acres and in 
their distinguished names. 

The comfortable frame house, in which June had 
spent the days of his slavehood, had long since gone 
up in smoke, for no habitation of man or beast was 
too lowly to escape the torch of Sherman's bummers, 
who, in 1865 illumined the "benighted South." Upon 
its site now stands a clay- chimneyed log cabin, and by 
its door ebb and flow the waters of the creek from 
which June had for years drawn his sustenance. 
While he did not exactly "go down to the sea in ships," 
he paddled his little "dugout" canoe out to the mouth 
of the stream at nearly every low tide during the 
winter season, and shared with the raccoons the little 
sharp-shelled bunch o}^sters that covered the exposed 
mud banks. 

In the spring, when the yellow jessamine swung its 
golden cups above the forest undergrowth, and the 
silver stars of the dogwood gleamed from the chapar- 

242 



THE DOCTOR DIDN'T "EXCEED" 

ral, he mended his nets and lines in preparal ion for the 

summer campaign, and, later, when the woods were 
odorous with the blossoms of the elder and the wild 
grape, he commenced his nocturnal forays against 
the finny tribes. On dark nights, when the piping of 
the marsh hens apprised him that the tide was out. 
he took with him a boy to paddle his cranky little 
craft, and. standing in the bow, threw his cast-net with 
a ''swish" far out into the schools of shrimp ami 
"finger mullet." His catch, together with an occa- 
sional string of whiting and yellowtail taken with 
the hook and line, he converted at a distant village 
into the necessaries of life. 

For many years there had scarcely been a ripple 
on this placid life of June's, save when a "puppy- 
shark" would occasionally make away with his bait, 
sending the whiting line whizzing through his fingers 
and almost upsetting the little craft with his impet- 
uous rush, or when, two or three times a year, the 
itinerant preacher would visit his cabin to swap 
ecclesiastical platitudes for fresh fish. 

On a bright day in early summer, old June sat at 
his door-step basking in the sun and watching the 
glistening waters as they hurried by. Occasionally, a 
kingfisher would leave his station on a dead limb and. 
zig-zagging in his flight, would swoop down on some 
small fish that showed on the surface, and. having 
swallowed his prey, would leisurely return to his 
perch with a harsh note of triumph. The "preechuh 
on de sukkus" had just arrived to pay his periodical 
visit, and, scattering a group of half-naked children 
who were playing around the door, June brought out 



THE BLACK BORDER 

another three-legged stool and extended the hospitali- 
ties of the establishment. 

"Reb'ren'," said he, "I berry glad you come teday." 

"Why, bredduh, 'smattuh mekso?" 

"Well, suh," said June, whose philosophical patience 
and faith might put to the blush many who quarrel 
with their lot, "I yent min' 'bout me myself, suh, 
"cause I tengk Gawd fuh life en' de bre't' w'at Him

24.1 



THE LADY COULDN'T "SPECIFY" 

The Rev. Nepchun Kinlaw, the "locus pastuh" of 
a Colleton County flock, sat in the sunshine at the door 
of his cabin, drawing from the sights and sounds 
around him inspiration for his next Sunday's sermon. 

Although he could not read, an open Bible was on 
his knee, and his head was bowed reverently over the 
well-thumbed pages. His only knowledge of their 
contents was acquired from the circuit preacher whose 
quarterly sermons furnished the "class-leaders" and 
local preachers with scriptural data wherewith to con- 
duct the campaign against Satan until his next round. 
These Bible truths "Pa Kinlaw" — as the female mem- 
bers of his charge delighted to call him — instilled into 
his flock by homely illustrations. Out in the yard 
before him, a little ridge of earth, which gradually 
increased in length, indicated the presence of a 
groundmole that was burrowing through the hard 
ground. "Dat grirmole hab fait'," said he. " 'E yent 
gots no eye een 'e head, en' 'e cyan' see de wurrum een 
de cart" 1 , but 'e hab fait', en' de Lawd lead'um 'long to 
weh de wurrum does lib, en' de gru'mole ketch de wur- 
rum en' eat'um. Same fashi'n, man en" 'ooman gots

specify w'en Gabrull blow 'e hawn en' de great day 
come. Ef you ent got fait\ please Gawd, oonuh neb- 
buh ketch de wurrum ub Salwashun!" 

His reflections were rudely interrupted by the advent 
of Jim Green, the colored constable of a neighboring 
trial justice, who, mounted on a razor-backed rat of a 
Texas pony, rode up to the door and, in the name of 

246 



THE LADY COULDN'T "SPECIFY" 

the State of South Carolina, demanded from the 
"Keb'ren"' a dollar and a quarter, the balance due od 
a two-dollar marriage ceremony performed in October 
last by the aforesaid trial justice, "who did then and 
there, at the time and place aforesaid, unite one 
Xepchun Kinlaw to one Minda Manigo." 

Not a red flag flaunted before a bull — nor a rival's 
becoming Easter bonnet before a society woman- 
could have been provocative of more wrath than was 
the constable's demand upon "Pa Kinlaw." Rising 
from his seat, with the natural color of his face deep- 
ened by anger until it was as dark as the hinges of 
Hades, he said: "Green, you kin go back to de Trial 
Jestuss en' telPum dat de lady, w'at him renite me to

A QUESTION OF PRIVILEGE 

The Republican State Convention was in session in 
the hall of the House of Representatives at Columbia. 
There was a contest between two rival delegations 
from Berkeley County, the one representing the "old 
line' 1 Republicans, the other the younger element which 
had recently affiliated with the conservative Demo- 
crats. The fight came up on the seating of the dele- 
gations, and it was agreed that five minutes should be 
allotted to the chairman of each delegation for the 
presentation of his claims to the convention. 

A young African, fancifully arrayed in a spotless 
white flannel suit, rose in behalf of the younger dele- 
gation and arraigned his opponents in an "impas- 
sioned" speech. 

Before his five minutes had expired, Mr. Thompson, 
the ape-like chairman of the elder statesmen, inter- 
rupted him with an appeal to the chair. 

"Mistuh Chair," said he, "I rise to uh squeschun lib 
priblidge." 

The Chair — "Does de juntlemun rise to de priblidge. 
eeduhso de squeschun?" 

"Great Gawd," said the thoroughly aroused dele- 
gate, "I rise to de priblidge en' de squeschun, alltwo

CONDUCTOR SMITHS DILEMMA 

Is there one, among the thousands that have 
traveled on his train, who does not know and, know- 
ing, does not esteem, Conductor Smith — "Billy" Smith 
of the Blue Ridge Railroad? Surely not, for like his 
prototype, Baines Carew, the sympathetic attorney of 
the Bab Ballads, who was so overcome by the recital 
of his clients' woes that he "had scarcely strength to 
take his fee," Billy, the embodiment of courtesy and 
kindliness, never collected a fare or punched a ticket 
without a deprecatory smile and look of sympathy, as 
tho' it grieved him very much. This accommodating 
disposition has made him an easy prey to an exacting 
public. Other trains have passed over his road, but the 
cream of the travel has always been reserved for Billy. 
His the happiness of looking after tow-headed boys 
sent to visit distant relatives; his the honor of escort- 
ing to and from boarding-school, grown girls who 
have been provided with half -fare tickets by their 
thrifty mothers; his the privilege of hauling to and 
fro, ladies who have been blessed with twins by a 
prodigal Providence, ladies with bird-cages, ladies 
with baby-carriages, ladies with cats in baskets, ladies 
with geraniums in pots, ladies with home-made jams 
and pickles in jars, ladies with bundles and bandboxes, 
ladies with an overweening desire to pour into his 
sympathetic ear divers family secrets — the exact num- 
ber of teeth the last baby but one has cut, the num- 
ber and variety of fashionable ailments considerately 
diagnosed by their family physicians, etc., etc. With 
these and like confidences the patient conductor's time 
is not infrequently whiled away between stations. 

252 



CONDUCTOR SMITH'S DILEMMA 

Thus for years has Billy Smith trod — or rather jog- 
gled along — the path of duty between Walhalla and 
Belton. In the spring-time, when rill and river are 
swollen by heavy rains, and the tawny waters rush 
down the hillsides, gullying the plowed lands and scat- 
tering the rich soil "'out among the neighbors," when 
the pale blue wild violet and the waxen Easter lily 
peep from dell and dingle, and the peach and plum 
trees, clustering around the farmsteads, open their 
pink and white petals to the sunshine and the dew: in 
the summer, when the golden bees swarm over the 
clover blooms and the ripe grain falls before the sweep 
of the scythe; in the autumn, when the chestnut burrs 
lie on the sod and the dead leaves swirl in the blast; 
in the winter, when the Blue Ridge is wrapped in a 
slumber-robe of snow and the frost crystals, forced out 
of the icy earth, sparkle on the sides of the deep cuts— 
in all seasons and in all weathers — Billy Smith plods 
on. Time and toil have streaked his beard with gray, 
and deepened the lines in his face, but his smile is as 
sweet and his hands and feet as willing as ever they 
were in his younger days, and, until he shall run his 
last train through the golden gates of the new Jerusa- 
lem and pass in his manifests to be checked up by the 
Almighty Auditor, he will doubtless be seen at the 
termini of the Blue Ridge Railroad, loaded to the 
gunwales, like a lighter at a coaling station, with 
babies, pug dogs, flowering plants and all the miscel- 
laneous paraphernalia apparently inseparable from 
itinerant femininity, and will still take a commanding 
position in the centre of his coach and diurnally sing. 
alas! "that old sweet song:" "Belton. Helton! June 
tion Columbia and Greenville Railroad! About fifty 



THE BLACK BORDER 

minutes, fifty minutes, before the train comes for 
Columbia! Passengers going in the direction of 
Columbia will have to git off now, you'll have to git 
off, as this train leaves in about ten minutes, ten 
minutes, for Greenville, for Greenville — which is in 
the opposite direction from Columbia!" 

There are moments in every life when flowers are no 
longer sweet, and women no longer fair ; when there is 
no music in the song of birds, no merriment in the 
laughter of children, and all the world seems dark. 

One of these moments came to Billy Smith the other 
day, when Conductor Fielding of the main line 
unloaded at Belton, Diana Hawlback, an elderly black 
woman from Beaufort County, who, with her grand- 
daughter "Lizzybet'," a spotted pig in a bag, two barn- 
yard roosters and a hen, tied by the legs, four quarts 
of roasted peanuts, a bushel of "Crazy Jane" sweet 
potatoes, a large bundle of bedding, and divers and 
sundry other belongings, was on her way to Pendle- 
ton to visit relatives. "The fight came up," as the 
Congressional reporters say, "on the recurrence of the 
previous question," which was, in this case, an empha- 
tic demand for the payment of full fare for Diana's 
"gran'," "Lizzybet'," a leggy girl of apparently four- 
teen years of age. "Cap'n," said Diana, "dat gal is a 
'leben yeahs old gal, en' wehrebbuh I does tek'um on

ONE WAS TAKEN— THE OTHER LEFT 

On the hot white sand of a cart road that wound 
along the edge of a riceneld in lower Carolina, lay 
the stiffened body of a yellow, crop-eared cur. By his 
side, a companion in death, was a cottonmouth mocca- 
sin, beaten almost to a pulp. 

The road was flanked on either side by a canal half 
filled with stagnant water, dotted here and there with 
water lilies and shaded by the feathery foliage of the 
pond willows, while, among the clumps of rushes that 
fringed the edges, blue flags nodded. Over all, the July 
sun glared fiercely, and up on the willow branches, 
where, here and there, his rays penetrated the dense 
foliage, lay a water snake basking in the golden light. 
Now and then a blue heron — the "Po' Joe" of the 
plantation negro — rose lazily from his fishing station 
out in the riceneld, and, trailing his long legs after 
him, moved on to another "drop." The whole world 
seemed to be asleep in the warm sunshine — all the 
world save old Ca'lina Manigo, who sat on a cypress 
log by the side of the road and gazed sorrowfully at 
the dead dog, and the snake that had caused its death, 
while he muttered to himself: 

"Po' ole Horfas' dead, yaas, suh, dead en' gone !

Old Carolina Manigo sat on a three-legged stool 
at the door of his cabin, as he thus addressed his 
grand-daughter, Lucinda, a scrawny negress of twelve 
or thirteen years. With reluctant feet, the girl, a piti- 
ful object, approached him. Her dress and appear- 
ance were in keeping with the wretched poverty of her 
grandfather and all his surroundings, and evidenced 
the utter incapacity of the average negro, thrown by 
"freedom"' upon his own resources, to care decently 
for his family. The frowzy wool on her unkempt head 
had been plaited weeks before into little pigtails that 
bristled all over her crown like black caterpillars. Her 
face was gray with dirt, around her thick lips lingered 
the encrusted remnants of her sweet-potato dinner of 
the day before, while down her cheeks lay. like the 
rills of resinous gum that streak the bark of the pine 
tree '"boxed" for turpentine, the tracks of recent tears. 
Through the rifts in the ragged cotton dress that con- 
stituted her sole attire, her scraggy limbs showed as 
she walked, or Limped, rather, toward her grandfather. 
Around her left foot was wrapped a piece of burlap 
bagging, and, whenever she stepped upon it, her 
pinched face contracted with pain.

AN INTERRUPTED OFFERTORY 

Out at the edge of the woods that fringed a sea- 
island cotton field in the lower part of Colleton 
County, stood a little bush church — a primitive affair, 
constructed by setting four ten-foot stakes at the 
corners of a square, laying ridgepoles in their forked 
tops, and covering the whole with green boughs of the 
sweetgum. Humble as it was, this summer sanctuary 
of the Rev. Nepchun Kinlaw's congregation was as 
dear to them as was ever minareted mosque to Moslem, 
or cloister to Monk. Here, during the warm weather, 
when the more pretentious clapboard church became 
unbearably hot, they assembled two or three times a 
week to receive the pearls of theological thought that, 
clothed in the Gullah dialect of the Carolina coast, 
fell from the thick lips of their beloved "locus pastuh." 
Here, sheltered from sunshine and shower, they sat, 
like roosting chickens, on pine poles that, upholstered 
only with the bark that covered them, rested upon 
upright stakes sawed square at the top and driven into 
the ground. When these "pews" were filled to the 
ends, the overflow found lodgment on the stumps and 
logs that lay within sound of the preacher's voice in 
the environing forest. 

On a night in the early summer, an unusually large 
congregation had gathered at this trysting place of the 
faithful, for the news had spread that "Pa Kinlaw" 
was going to say something sensational on the subject 
of pastoral ways and means. The night was dark, the 
sky overcast, and now and then the low rumble of dis- 
tant thunder and a fitful gust of wind from the south- 

262 



AN INTERRUPTED OFFERTORY 

east, that soughed through the tops of the pines for B 
moment and then died away, betokened the coming 
storm. Around the place of worship, two or three 
pine-knot fires blazed brightly, furnishing, at once, 
light for the comfort of the congregation, and smoke 
for the discomfiture of the gnats and sandflies that 
swarmed about the church. Around and between the 
fires, the negroes, men and women, moved, avoiding 
the smoke and sparks that the wind, from time to 
time, sent among them, the firelight falling on their 
dark faces recalling the "hot-pot" scene in Rider Hag- 
gard's "She." While they awaited the advent of their 
preacher, they discussed their daily pleasures, trials, 
hopes and fears — the reduced cost of bacon or calico 
at the country store, the demand for labor, and the 
increased price therefor, at the rice plantations along 
the river, the destruction of the earlv corn bv the cut- 
worms and the crows, etc. 

"I yerry," said one old woman to another. "I yerry 
dat Mistuh FitzSimmun done tek de sprout How off V 
rice, en' 'e gwine hoe'um nex' week, T'ursday." 

"Dat so?" said her companion. "Den, I gwine dev

"Ring!" said Ca'lina, scornfully. "Ring! Boy, ef

Go'way, Paa'kuh, man, you know berry well yo' clog

'"Nuf t'ing, 'scusin' dog, dey een dis wull' w'at 
cyan' specify," said a deep voice from the darkness 
without, and, in a moment more, the long-looked-for 
pastor, mounted on a raw-boned brindled ox, rode 
into the broad disk of fire-light that filled the glade. 
A grain sack stuffed with corn shucks was his saddle, 
and a long grapevine wound around and around the 
unhappy ox, together with martingales and crupper 
of the same, held it in place. A bridle and stirrups of 
frayed cotton rope completed the extraordinary eques- 
trian equipment. 

"Cow iz shishuh 'ceitful t'ing fuh ride, dat I mos' 
didn' mek me 'p'int," said the preacher, as he dis- 
mounted and hitched his animal to a bush. 

"Paul Jinkin' got some shinny peas plant close by 
de road aige, en' dis cow bin so hongry dat, w'en I 
git to weh de fench bruk down, 'e tek "eself en' me en'

yent want'uh git de cow' cyarrictuh spile, so 1 mek'um

Taking his stand in the tall box of rough pine 
boards that served for a pulpit, he looked askance - A \ 
the contributions to his support that various members 
of his congregation brought to the altar and laid on 
the ground beside him. A quart of grist, a dozen eggs, 
a chicken, a pint of "clean" rice, a nickle — ostentati- 
ously brought forth from a knot in the corner of an 
apron and placed by the proud donor ; 'een de Reb- 
'ren' han'" — such were the offerings of this simple 
people, but, although representing more than a tithe 
of their possessions, they found little favor in the 
pastor's eyes. 

"Sistuh Wineglass," said he, as a bustling middle- 
aged woman smilingly presented a chicken. "Sistuh 
Wineglass, chickin' seems to sca'ceful een dis congre- 
srashun ez debble sca'ceful een heab'n ! Dis meb only

The pastor's prelude was brought to a sudden close 
by a deafening peal of thunder that echoed and 
re-echoed through the forest. A gust of wind lifted 
the sweetgum thatch from the rafters of the little 
church and scattered the boughs to leeward, and, as 
the big raindrops began to fall upon the assembled 
worshipers, Pa Kinlaw gathered together his prog, 
mounted his ox, and trotted oif in the darkness, call- 
ing to his flock as he went, "de Lawd en' me alltwo

A FLAW IN THE "EENDITEMENT" 

She came into the office of a Walterboro lawyer and 
engaged his services to reverse, upset and "spile" the 
decision of a trial justice who had just fined her "nine 
dolluh' en' de cawss', suh," for obstructing a public 
highway. 

Grace Rivers was her "eentitlement." The color of 
her skin was so deep that a piece of charcoal drawn 
across her face would have left a pallid mark. Al- 
though literallv on the "shadv side" of seventy, she 
was not regardless of the advantages of dress, and her 
costume was, like Katisha's left elbow, worth ''coming 
miles to see." The gray wool that covered her head 
was snarled and tangled like a burry merino pelt, but 
a man's black straw hat, battered and weather-stained, 
was set upon it as jauntily as was ever w T orn the rakish 
cap of Fra Diavolo ! "When a fashion-plate had last 
been seen in her habitat near Ion's Cross Roads, 
bustles were "the thing." Although these protuber- 
ances on the human form divine had long since been 
called in and relegated to the rear (?) they were still 
"the thing" for Grace. The balloon bustle of the 
society actress, the oscillating bustle, the coiled-spring 
variety that rebelled at being sat upon, and, when 
"crushed to earth," like truth, would "rise again," hav- 
ing passed away, were not now obtainable at the 
country stores; so the ingenuity of this dusky devotee 
of fashion was called into play, and she had con 
structed as unique a "dress improver" as was ever worn 
under the sun — or under a home-spun skirt, either, for 
that matter. A rift in the rear of her gown disclosed 

2G7 



THE BLACK BOBBER 

the mechanism of this work of art, which was merely 
a piece of an iron barrel hoop, bent into a half-elipse, 
and wound with two or three thicknesses of cotton 
bagging. Primitive as it was, it sufficed to elevate the 
hind part of her skirt several inches above the level of 
the lower periphery of the front breadth, which was 
hidden by an apron made of a rough-dried guano sack, 
on which appeared in bold stenciled letters, "Ashepoo 
Acid Phosphate, 200 pounds — privilege tax paid." 

Taking a seat in the counsellor 's office, she said:

"Well," said the attorney, when he had stemmed

"I baig'um, I tell'um, 'Mistuh Awkuhmun, I want to

OLD WINE-NEW BOTTLES 

He lived in Spartanburg, and was the proud valet 
(pronounced "valley" in the up-country) of a young 
physician. Whether the charcoal hue of his face, or 
his employer's profession, prompted a clever woman 
to bestow upon him the appellation of "the valley of 
the shadow of death,"' I do not know, but it certainly 
seemed, to every one acquainted with him, a peculiarly 
appropriate u eentit\ement." 

Whence he came was a mystery. He tramped into 
the town one day, with his kinky wool full of the red 
dust of the up-country roads and his mouth full of the 
Gullah dialect of the coast, and asked for work. Al- 
though not more than thirteen years of age, his hard- 
ened muscles and pinched face indicated that he had 
known both toil and starvation. "Gran'puh lick me 
en I run'way en' lef'um," was all he said, and, as he 
proved industrious and reasonably honest, there was 
no further inquiry into his antecedents. 

One day, soon after he had established himself in 
his Spartanburg sanctuary, I chanced, while on a visit 
to the low-country, to learn something of his history. 
Passing through a plantation, formerly the home of a 
distinguished South Carolina family, but now aban- 
doned to the occupancy of a few negro squatters, 
whose slovenly agricultural methods extracted but a 
scanty subsistence from the naturally fertile soil, I 
came to a miserable cabin, half a mile away from the 
main settlement. On its site had once stood a com 
fortable frame house of the type in general use on 
Southern plantations for ante-bellum negro quarters,

but the woodwork had long since been destroyed by 
fire, and the brick chimney alone remained. Among 
the negroes of the coast, where brick are scarce and the 
cabin chimneys are generally made of clay or mud, the 
possession of a brick "chimbly" is a sort of badge of 
aristocracy and a passport to high position in colored 
society, and old Scipio Smashum, having been a house 
servant before the war, and, retaining through all the 
hardships that had come to him with freedom, a pro- 
found contempt for the coarser-fibred "field hands,'' 
preferred to live apart from them, and had reared 
around the isolated brick chimney a habitation which, 
even when new, was never weatherproof, and was now 
in a pitiable state of dilapidation. 

From the pine saplings, of which the walls were 
constructed, the rotting bark had fallen away, dis- 
closing the perforations of the wood borers or "saw- 
yers," whose industry had almost honey-combed the 
sappy logs. The clapboards which covered the house 
were falling to pieces with decay, and here and there 
on the weather-worn roof lay, like oases in a desert of 
gray, patches of green mould. 

' The surroundings of the cabin were as unkempt and 
unattractive as the building itself. Dogfennel and 
"Jimpson" weed grew almost up to the threshold. A 
few rows of corn and beans in a garden nearby were 
choked with grass and had been abandoned soon after 
the plants were up. The "wattled" fence of clapboards 
surrounding it was tumbling down, and through the 
fallen panels the neighbors' cows and pigs roamed at 
will. On the top of a little log chicken coop, a young 
Dominique rooster cackled loudly while he awaited the 
coining of his partner, who was. at the moment, busied 
with domestic duties within. 



OLD WINE— NEW BOTTLES 

On a bench near the door sat old Scipio. The wool 
which covered his head was as white as the back of a 
Cotswold sheep, and the face, in which his bleared and 
jaundiced eves were deeply set, was seamed with care. 

As I approached, he was upbraiding the boastful 
rooster. "You so 'laagin*. Soon ez yo' lady git on V

A GULLAH GLOSSARY 

The Glossary included in this volume, while making im pre- 
tense to absolute accuracy, is offered as a workable list <>f 
the words in common use by the Negroes of the South Caro- 
lina coast. It is doubtful, however, if the vocabulary of 
any single individual comprises more than half the list, for 
many words in everyday use about Georgetown or Charles- 
ton occur rarely at Beaufort, or on the Combahee. Then. 
too, many terms and expressions have only a local signifi- 
cance. On the seacoast and along the lower reaches of tin- 
tidal rivers, "trus'-me-Gawd" (I trust my Cod) is the com- 
mon name for the cranky, unseaworthy dugout canoe, the 
hazard of whose use on the rough waters of the coast 
implies faith in the w r atchful care of a divine Providence. 
Higher up the same river, however, where smoother waters 
exact smaller faith, the coffin-like craft is merely a "coo-noo," 
a "cun-noo," or a "con-noo." 

He who adventures into Gullah and would "make head 
or tail" of its queer phonetics, must keep in mind the sounds 
"uh," "e," "ran," and "a." In no other tongue, perhaps, can 
so much be expressed with so little strain upon brain or lips 
or glottis as by the Gullah's laconic use of these grunting 
jungle-sounds. 

To the Gullah, the naked "a" at the top of the firsl 
column of the dictionary is "uh," the dominant note upon 
which his speech is pitched. With "uh" he boastfully pro- 
claims the personal pronoun "I." As "bubbuh," or "budduh," 
or "buh," he greets his brethren; as "sistuh," or "tittuh." 
his sisters. Sweet potatoes he roasts and eats as "tettuh." 
His father, mother, daughter, are "farruh. nmrruh. daa'tuh;" 
his ever is "ebbuh," his never is "nebbuh ;" forever, "fuhreb- 
buh." His answer is "ansuh." his master is "inastuh." his 
pastor is "pastuh" (and so is his pasture) ; his either i- 
"eeduh," his neither is "needuh," his fever is "febuh," lli - 
river is "ribbuh," his cooter is "cootuh," his silver is "silbuh." 
If in daylight he falls asleep in an open place, the vulture's 
wing that hovers over him will cast a "shaddidi." Hi- neigh- 
bor is "navuh." his favor is "fabuh." his labor is "lavuh,' 1 



THE BLACK BORDER 

his Savior is "Sabeyuh." His bother is "bodduh," his other 
is "odduh," his t'other is "todduh ;" another, "anodduh." 
Otter is "ottuh ," and 'gator is " 'gatuh ;" better, "mo'bettuh," 
and alligator, "alligettuh." Barrow is "barruh," burrow is 
"hurrah," furrow is "furruh," harrow is "harruh," borrow 
is "borruh ;" tomorrow, "tomorruh." His mourner is "mo'nuh," 
and so is his more than (more nor) and corner is "cawnuh," 
"mauma" is "maumuh," "maussa" is "maussuh," cover is 
"kibbuh ;" uncover, "onkibbuh," the white man is "buckruh," 
the Negro is "Nigguh." And finger is "finguh," as ginger is 
"ginjuh." Pshaw is "shuh," and sir is "suh." His feather 
is "fedduh," his weather is "wedduh," his measure is "med- 
juh," his pleasure is "pledjuh." And if, in pleasantry or 
wrath, he cries out upon a compatriot, he scornfully apos- 
trophizes him as "uh Gulluh nigguh !" 

Following "uh' in frequency of occurrence comes " 'e," a 
contraction of he, she (but used also for it) — usually pro- 
nounced as "ee" in see, but sometimes approaching "e" in 
set and "i" in sit ; but, without the use of diacritical marks, 
the exact shading cannot be expressed. This " 'e" is ever 
in the Gullah mouth. If a man has shuffled off this mortal 
coil, " 'e dead ;" if a fruitful woman has blessed the earth, 
" 'e hab chile ;" if the dusky infant cries out upon the world, 
" 'e cry ;" if a mule be too free with her hindlegs, " 'e kick." 
If winter comes, " 'e freeze," and in summer weather " 'e 
hot." If a storm approaches, " 'e gwine to wedduh ;" when 
it breaks, " 'e t'unduh, 'e lightnin', 'e blow win', 'e rain." 

In "Myths of the Georgia Coast," Colonel Jones's Gullahs 
pronounce this contraction "eh," but with this a clearer 
phonetic apprehension of the Gullah does not permit agree- 
ment. "Eh" is a good English word which the Gullah pro- 
nounces correctly and frequently utters in the ejaculation 
"eh, eh !" to express surprise or bewilderment. 

Almost the twin of " 'e" is "um," expressing him, her, it 
and them. Did that man steal your pig? " 'E t'ief'um." 
Did the woman whip the boy? " 'E lick'um." Did the fire 
burn your house? " 'E bu'n'um." Have you finished your 
task? "Uh done'um." Did you shoot those crows? "Uh 
shoot'um." And "um" added to see or saw becomes "shum." 

278 



A GULLAII GLOSSARY 

See that woman? "Uh shum." Did you see her yesterday? 
"Uh shum." Will you see her tomorrow? "Uh gwine shum." 
"Shum" expresses see, seeing-, or saw him, her. it. or them. 

If the Gullah Negro, in "full him" and "fuh she." char 
the pronoun to "um," he adds an "r" for euphony and utters 
a rolling "fuhr'um;" and, similarly, "tuh him." "tuli she" are 
changed to "tuhr'um." 

The Gullah's favorite pronunciation of our fust vowel is 
that of "a" in at, hat, bat — words that, like all others having 
the same "a" sound, he invariably pronounces correctly. 
Drawled to the double "a" as in "baa," it does yeoman service 
in "paat\" path; "paa't," part; "smaa't." smart; "cyaa't," 
cart; "h'aa't," heart; "shaa'p," sharp; "baa'n." barn; "yaa'd." 
yard; "maamy," mother; "maa'k," mark; "staa't," start: 
and so in many other words. 

In the Gullah there are many contradictions, the Negro 
sometimes taking surprisingly short-cuts, expressing himself 
succinctly and saying a great deal with but a mouthful of 
words; while at others he rambles interminably and wanders 
so far afield in his verbal intoxication that he can hardly 
come soberly again to his starting point. 

In this tongue one word or combination of words fre- 
quently does duty for singular and plural numbers, past 
and present tenses, and for masculine, feminine, and neuter 
genders. Thus "Uh shum" may mean I saw him, I see him, 
I saw her, I see her, I saw it. I see it, I saw them. I Bee 
them. So "Uh tell'um" means I told or 1 tell him, her, or 
them. Oxen and bulls, as well as cows, are generally classi- 
fied and denominated as "cow," oxen as "ox," "two OX," 
"ten ox," etc., while a single ox. if not called a "cow." is 
invariably "one oxin." " 'Ooman" is both woman and women : 

"man" stands also for men. although "mens" is someti 6 

used for the plural, as "free man." or "fo' mens." 

Many words the Gullahs pronounce correctly. These are 
here spelled in the normal way. as to respell them would 
result only in a useless mutilation of the text. 

Very often the Gullah usage consists in new and peculiar 

applications of words, twisted to i t its own needs, and 

making a single vocable serve the purpose of many. 

279 



THE BLACK BORDER 

With a single "knock," the Gullah knocks, has knocked, is 
knocking. 

With but a "rock," he rocks, has rocked, is rocking. 

With "fight," he fights, has fought, is fighting. 

With "run," he runs, has run, is running; and so on with 
many other words, used to express singular and plural num- 
bers, or all the simple tenses of the verb. 

While the Gullah usually holds fast to his favorite pro- 
nunciation, he sometimes permits himself a grotesque varia- 
tion. For example, his usual pronunciation of car is "cyaa\" 
which he utters as flatly as a Charlestonian of the Battery ; 
but should he permit himself a "cyaar," he will roll you an 
"r" as raucously as any Ohioan. 

Of course, all Gullah Negroes pronounce certain English 
words correctly, while others approximate, in varying de- 
grees, the speech of their former masters. This fact ac- 
counts for the slight variations that will be noticed in the 
speech of different individuals in these stories, and in the 
several pronunciations sometimes occurring in the Glossary. 
For example, the Gullah word for you, ye, your, yours, is 
variously pronounced "ona, oona, oonuh, unnuh," and, among 
dyed-in-the-wool dialecticians, "yunnuh" and "wunnuh." So, 
the Orang-utan is called by some " 'Rangatang" and by the 
extremists " 'Ranguhtang." 

Warm is "wawm ;" form or inform, "fawm," "eenf awm ;" 
morning is "mawnin' ;" corn, "cawn ;" horse or horses, 
"hawss ;" horn, "hawn ;" born, "bawn ;" cow is correctly 
pronounced, and calf is near enoiigh to the Charleston usage 
to pass. Tore, torn, tears, and tearing are never used, tear 
taking the place of all. As : the girl tore her petticoat — "De 
gal tayre 'e 'coat." That man's shirt is torn — "Da' man' 
shu't tayre." This cloth tears badly — "Dis clawt' tayre bad." 
They are tearing off the boards — "Dem duh (does) tayre off 
de boa'd'." 

Them ("dem") is universally used for they and their. 
They took off their shoes — "Dem tek off dem shoesh." Dog 
and hog, while sometimes drawled, are very rarely length- 
ened to "dawg" and "hawg," tno' God is almost invariably 
"Gawd." The contraction of your is "yo' ;" and yet. for 

280 



A GULLAH GLOSSARY 

yours, instead of "yo'n" — the mountaineers' "yourn"- thej 
prefer "you'own," as theirs or their own is always "dem'own." 

Unlike Mr. Weller, the Gullah does not affect the Letter 
V. which he always changes to W or B — Violet modestlj 
shrinking to Wi'let or Bi'let, while, as Benus, the amorous 
Aphrodite doubtless loves quite as ardently in her humble 
way. And the soft and teasing vex suggests, as "hex." anger 
swift and passionate! 

"Lukkuh," or "same lukkuh," a corruption of like unto or 
same like unto — "same lukkuh" occasionally shortened into 
"sukkuh" by an excited or rapid talker — express likeness. 
resemblance. 

"Hukkuh" is, of course, how come, or how came. 

" 'E fat" means that the man, the woman, the pig. or the 
lightwood, is or was fat. " 'E fat fob. true" (in truth) adds 
emphasis, while " 'E fat fuh sowl" brooks no contradiction. 

" 'Puntop," sometimes " 'puntap," or " 'pantap," on or near 
Edisto Island, means not only on top and on, but at. As: "l)e 
squinch owl light 'puntop de chimbly ;" "Him plant' 'puntop 
Cum bee ribbuh ;" "Wen uh look 'puntop de 'ooman en' see 
'e yeye red, uh know him bex." "Biggin" is equivalent to 
begin, began, begun, or beginning. 

"Haffuh" is both have to and had to. "Wen de strain 
leff'um to John' Ilun', him haffuh tek him foot en' gone spang 
town," meaning when she missed the train at John's Island 
station she had to walk all the way to Charleston. 

"Same fashi'n," expressing likeness, has no sartorial sig- f \ 
nifieance. 

"Alltwo" may mean both or each; as: "alligettuh en' coo- 
tuh alltwo stan' same fashi'n, alltwo hab fo' foot en' one tail. 
en' alltwo trabble 'puntop dem belly." So "stan" Lukkuh" 
and "stan' sukkuh" mean look alike or bear a dose resem- 
blance, whether standing, sitting, crawling, lying, (lying, or 
swimming. 

"Wuffuh," or "woft'uh," means why, or what for. 

At times, "duh" and "suh" (not the "sub" for sir) have 
peculiar usage. "Wuffuh you duh do datV" What for, or whj 
are you doing that? "Him gone duh ribbuh," ae has gone to 
the river. "Him walk duh paat'," he walks in the path (or 

281

the road). So, too, " 'e duh sleep" for he does sleep, or he 
sleeps ; and "duh wintuh time" for in the winter or during 
the winter. "Nuh" is another oddity, "me nuh him" being 
he and I. 

Many years ago, the Eeverend Kinlaw, upon hearing an 
educated darkey reading aloud one of the Kinlaw sermons 
from a newspaper, exclaimed : "Uh 'cla' to Gawd da' buckruh 
do me too bad ! Dem t'ing suh him suh suh me susso, me 
nubbuh susso. Me t'ink'um, aw, but uh nubbuh susso, en' 
how de debble him know suh me t'ink'um, w'en uh nubbuh 
susso?" Which, interpreted, means: "I declare that buckra 
did me too bad. Those things that he said I said, I never said 
so. I thought them, it is true, but I never said them, and 
how did he know that I thought them, when I never said 
them?" Kinlaw was an extremely uncouth creature and his 
Gullah was of the rankest, spoken with the hot-potato-in-the- 
mouth effect of the low-comedy stage Irishman, hence his 
use of "suh" for that as well as for said, and of "nubbuh" 
for never, instead of the usual "nebbuh." 

"Aw," for true, or to be sure, is seldom used. 

"Ki," rarely "kwi," or "kwoy," is an exclamation. 

"Nyam," or "nyam-nyam," means to eat. 

"Bittle," is, of course, victuals — food. 

"Blan," pronounced with the nasal resonance of the French 
"blanc," but without the broad "a" sound, or as the French 
would pronounce "blin," is probably a corruption of belong, 
and means used to or accustomed to. 

"Study" means to think, ponder, plan. 

The Gullah, like the Queen of Spain, has no legs, "foot" 
serving for the lower limbs as well as for their extremities. 
"Deer hab long foot, him run fas' ;" "Cootuh hab shawt foot, 
him trabble slow." 

"Yez" is ear or ears, and "yeddy," sometimes "yerry," is 
hear, or hearing, heard; Avhile "haa'kee" (hark ye) is also 
hear, and so on, whether addressed to one or to more persons, 
and is used not only in admonition, as "haa'kee at me good 
fashi'n," but is sometimes spoken lightly, as certain modern 
flappers and their bifurcated companions say "listen !" 
"Haa'kee" also does duty interchangeably for "yeddy," as 

282 



A GULL All GLOSSAL' V 

"haa'kee att'um." "yeddy'um"— hearken to him! tear him! 
\,ul one who holds a warning as of small account, will 
often say in response to an admonitory "haa'kee!' "Yaas, 
bnbbuh, nh haa'kee, but uh vent yeddy" -literalTj , 1 hearken 
but I don't hear, while actually meaning I hear bul 1 don I 
heed "oing in one ear and coming out of the other. 

«'Nuf" means not only enough, sufficiency, bul more often 
abundance. Thus "you nab enny mint?" "Yaas, sun, we bab 
•„„f" carries assurance of not merely enough for a te* 
juleps, but a patch of fragrant greenery that could cover the 
waves of a score of old-school Virginians! 
'"Specify" one of the most characteristic Gullah words, 
from the English "specify," serves for most of the varied 
meanings of "speeifications"-"making good." It a woman 
proves an unsuitable mate, she "cyan' specify." If trouscr> 
are frail, and "de britchiz buss'," " 'e yent specify. 1 a 
"cunnoo" proves unsea worthy-" him cyan' specify. And 
even of a Bible text, the fulfilment of whose promise seems 
inadequate, the Gullah says: "Buhrabbus' wu'd, him en1 

snecifv berry well." 

"Entv." "ent," "vent," sometimes "ain'," serve for isnt, 
aren't, didn't, don't, doesn't. "Ent you shum?" "enty you 
shum?" may mean didn't you see? or don't you see. him, her. 

'Vreceded by a soft vowel sound, "iz" and "ent" are changed 
to "viz" and "yent;" as: "him iz," "him ent," become, by tin 
substitution of "V for him, " 'e yiz," " 'e yent. 
"'Cep'n'" is except or excepting, and so is scusm

predominates, "daddy" and "mauma" take their places. For 
that reason, perhaps, white children in the low-country never 
call their fathers "daddy," pa or papa frequently taking the 
place of the more formal "father." 

Where the name of the person addressed or spoken of is 
used, "mauma" is changed to "maum," as "Maum Kate." 

The simple name of the month is seldom sufficient, but 
must be fortified by the addition of "munf," as : "Uh hab 
da' gal een June munf." 

Second, third, etc., are seldom used, the preferred forms 
being "two-time," "t'ree-time," etc. "Uh done tell oonuh 
fuh de two-time fuh lef da' gal 'lone" — I've told you for the 
second time to leave that girl alone ; and "two-time" is in- 
variably used for twice. "Uh done call you two-time" — I've 
called you twice. The third Tiiesday in August would be "De 
free Chuesday een Augus'." 

"Onrabble 'e mouf " — unravel her mouth, for it's always 
a feminine skein that's to be unwound — is as comprehensive 
as it is picturesque. At times the verbal tide flows on un- 
checked from a full ball of yarn ; again, the ravelings are 
pulled angrily, jerkily, from the warp of a threadbare sub- 
ject. "Onrabble 'e mouf!" 

"Lef " — left — is given not only its own proper meaning, 
but serves for leave, leaving, as "loss" does extra duty for 
lose, losing, lost. 

"She-she talk" — a contemptuous characterization by Gullah 
bucks of feminine gossip — is suggestive of the whispering 
frou-frou of silken petticoats. 

"En' f ing' " — and things — is a verbal grab-bag comprehen- 
sive enough to hold every etcetera, animate or inanimate, that 
one may lay tongue to. A woman's "chillun en' f ing' " may 
cover her chickens as well as her children ; her "husbun' en'

ence to King Solomon's "wife en' f ing' " would assuredly 
have lumped in with his wives every petticoat on the "Pro- 
verbial" premises ! 

The Gullah contraction of defend, is " 'fen'," yet. if that 
defense be inadequate, he will invariably "refen' " himself. If 
he anoint, 'tis " 'n'int," yet his pastor is the Lord's "re- 
nointed."

A GULL All GLOSSARY 

As the Gullah's tongue has no trouble with "cart'*' In- 
correctly pronounced contraction of "earth"- he should have 
no difficulty with dirt or shirt, but these arc invariably pro- 
nounced "du't" and "shu't ;" and, although the "uh" sound 
is so easily uttered, he always "shets" a door, and tries to 
"shet," but never shuts, his lady's mouth. 

Among the Negroes on Pon Pon, Stepney— a man's name 
— is commonly used as a synonym for hunger, want, lie who 
hoped to keep the wolf away would "haffuh wu'k haa'd fuh 
keep Stepney frum de do'," while the fabled ant would ad- 
monish La Cigale, the grasshopper, "tek care, gal. you duh 
sing duh summuhtime, tek care Stepney don' conic ecu yo' 
house 'fo' wintuhtime !" 

There are, of course, many variations, some Negroes using 
only a few Gullah words, while practically all the house 
servants spoke without a taint. During the Confederate War. 
Phyllis, a highly trained young maid who had been taught 
deportment under Maum Bella, a fine old family servant in 
Charleston, once "impeached" the language of the five-year 

old boy under her charge. "Mass , you shouldn't say 

path, you should say parth." How a broad "a" got loose in 
Charleston one can't imagine, unless it came in with the 
buxom Virginia girls who periodically descended upon "*t In- 
City" to marry her most eligible young men. 

The Gullah grabs his prophets, his kin^s. and his apostles 
out of the Old and New Testaments, haphazard, and hms 
them as they come, "to point a moral or adorn a tale" and 
he believes in elaborate adornment. 

Himself unlettered, he catches the names as they « ie to 

his ears from the lips of the whites, or of educated Negr 
and frecpiently gets his personnel inextricably mixed, the 
mouth-filling "Nickuhdemus" being quite as frequently turned 
out to graze, "bite grass," as the esteemed "Nebuhkuhnezzuh." 
The Apostle Paul is most often quoted by the class-leaders 
and local preachers, but they love to mouth over "Buhrab- 
bus," while entirely ignorant of the character. 

What Old Testament book can it be that the Gullah calls 
"Rebus?" Perhaps some Bible student will hazard a guess. 
It may be a far-fetched corruption of Genesis, for. in vr i n i i i g

assurance of his having pursued a subject or an investiga-

Edisto Island was, before the war, through the fine Sea 
Island cotton produced there, one of the garden spots of the 
earth, and has been for many generations noted for the hos- 
pitality, culture, and refinement of its families ; but in old 
times it was also noted for an unusual provincialism and for 
the habitual use of Gullah dialect by many of the planters' 
young sons. These were in constant association with their 
slaves on hunting and fishing parties, and unconsciously 
adopted the highly picturesque and expressive speech of their 
black servitors. They were accordingly subjected to many 
hard stories by their neighbors on the main land, who de- 
clared that, when the tardy news of Napoleon's exile to St. 
Helena, one hundred years ago, reached Edisto, the young 
islanders, believing their neighboring island of St. Helena to 
be the place of safe-keeping, were apprehensive of another 
"return from Elba," and, fearing the great Corsican as a 
potential liberator of their precious slaves, held an indig- 
nation meeting and resolved that : "Ef dem buckruh' 'pantap 
Sa'leenuh choose fuh hab 'Poleon come 'pantap dem ilun\ 
berry well, but, uh swaytoGawd, him cyan' come 'pantap dis 
ilun', 'cause dat duh dainjus buckruh, en', fus' t'ing wunnuh 
know, him set we Nigguh' free." 

The Edisto marshes abounded in wild donkeys, and a 
favorite Sunday amusement used to be the chevying of these 
unhappy animals out of the marshes by the white and black 
boys who, using sections of jackvine for whips, chased them 
over the plantations. A story is told of a young Edisto 
Islander who, a few days after matriculation at the Univer- 
sity of Virginia, was requested by his fellow students to tell 
them something about the favorite sports and amusements of 
the South Carolina coast. He enlightened them as follows : 
"Great King wunnuh boy ! Me nuh Cud jo blan hab fun 
duh Sunday. Cudjo him ketch long tail' hawss, me ketch 
shawt tail' hawss ; we tek dem jack-wine, run dem jackass 
ont'uh maa'sh, run'um all obuh plantesshun ; den we blan go
